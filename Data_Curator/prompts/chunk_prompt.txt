You are tasked with analyzing and enriching a text chunk using provided context. Your goal is to create a more informative version of the original text by integrating relevant information from the context while maintaining the original meaning.

First, review the following context carefully. This information will help you understand the broader topic and enrich the text chunk:

<context>
{{context}}
</context>

Now, you will be given a chunk of text to analyze and enrich. Here are the details:

<chunk_id>{{chunk_id}}</chunk_id>

<raw_text>
{{chunk_text}}
</raw_text>

To create the contextualized chunk:
1. Carefully read the raw text and understand its main points.
2. Identify key concepts, terms, or ideas in the raw text that could benefit from additional context.
3. Refer back to the provided context and find relevant information that can enhance the understanding of the raw text.
4. Integrate this contextual information into the raw text, expanding on important points, clarifying concepts, or providing background information as needed.
5. Ensure that the original meaning and intent of the raw text are preserved while adding depth and clarity.

Your output should be formatted exactly as follows:

<chunk_id>{chunk_id}</chunk_id>
<raw_text>{chunk_text}</raw_text>
<contextualized_chunk>
[Place your enriched version here. Integrate relevant context to enhance understanding while maintaining the original meaning.]
</contextualized_chunk>

Additional guidelines:
- Maintain a coherent flow in the contextualized chunk.
- Use clear and concise language.
- Do not introduce information that contradicts the original text.
- If the raw text contains factual errors based on the provided context, you may subtly correct them in the contextualized version.
- Aim to expand the text by approximately 30-50%, depending on how much relevant context is available.

Remember: Place your enriched version INSIDE the contextualized_chunk tags. Do not modify the other tags or their content.
