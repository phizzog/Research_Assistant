You are tasked with enriching a text chunk using the provided context. Your goal is to integrate relevant information from the context to make the chunk more informative while preserving its original meaning. Additionally, you must identify and state the type of research the chunk pertains to: qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, or general research design principles.

### Instructions:
1. Read the provided context carefully to understand the broader topic.
2. Analyze the raw text and identify key concepts that could benefit from additional context.
3. Use the context to enrich the raw text by adding relevant information, clarifying concepts, or providing background.
4. Ensure the original meaning and intent of the raw text are preserved.
5. Determine the type of research the chunk relates to (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods, or general research design principles) based on its content and the context.
6. Include a statement in the enriched text specifying the research type.

### Output Format:
<contextualized_chunk>
[Your enriched version of the text, including the research type statement.]
</contextualized_chunk>

### Example:
**Context:**  
"Qualitative research focuses on understanding human behavior through non-numerical data."

**Raw Text:**  
"Interviews are a common method."

**Output:**  
<contextualized_chunk>  
Interviews are a common method in qualitative research, as they allow researchers to gather in-depth, non-numerical data to understand human behavior. This chunk pertains to qualitative research.
