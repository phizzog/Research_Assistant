You are tasked with classifying a given text as either 'qualitative', 'quantitative', 'mixed', or 'general' research. To help you make this classification, please use the following definitions:

Qualitative Research:
<qualitative_def>
{{qualitative_def}}
</qualitative_def>

Quantitative Research:
<quantitative_def>
{{quantitative_def}}
</quantitative_def>

Mixed Methods:
<mixed_def>
{{mixed_def}}
</mixed_def>

Now, carefully read and analyze the following text:

<text_to_classify>
{{text}}
</text_to_classify>

Based on the definitions provided and your analysis of the text, determine which category it best fits into. Consider the following:

1. Does the text primarily discuss non-numerical data, experiences, or interpretations?
2. Does it focus on numerical data, statistical analysis, or measurable variables?
3. Does it combine both qualitative and quantitative elements?
4. If it doesn't clearly fit into any of these categories, it may be classified as 'general'.

Provide your reasoning for the classification in <reasoning> tags. Your reasoning should be concise but clear, explaining why you believe the text fits best into the chosen category.

After providing your reasoning, give your final classification as a single word response. Use ONLY ONE of these exact words: qualitative, quantitative, mixed, or general.

Your complete response should be structured as follows:

<reasoning>
[Your reasoning here]
</reasoning>
