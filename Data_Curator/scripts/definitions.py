This file stores definitions of key research approaches (qualitative, quantitative,
mixed methods) that we can reference in other modules for classification or prompts.
These definitions are paraphrased from the text to serve as an easy lookup. These were taken straight from the book:

"Research Methods: A Processual Approach" by John W. Creswell

DEFINITIONS = {
    "qualitative": (
        "Qualitative research is an approach for exploring and understanding "
        "the meaning individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human problem. "
        "The research process involves emerging questions and procedures, data typically "
        "collected in the participant's setting, data analysis inductively building from "
        "particulars to general themes, and the researcher making interpretations of the "
        "meaning of the data. The final written report has a flexible structure. Those who "
        "engage in this form of inquiry use an inductive style building from data to themes "
        "and a focus on individual meaning, and emphasize the importance of reporting the "
        "complexity of a situation."
    ),
    "quantitative": (
        "Quantitative research is an approach for testing objective theories by "
        "examining the relationship among variables or a comparison among groups. "
        "These variables, in turn, can be measured, typically on instruments, so that "
        "numbered data can be analyzed using statistical procedures. The final written "
        "report has a set structure comprising an introduction, methods, results, and "
        "discussion. Quantitative researchers test theories deductively, build into a "
        "study protections against bias, control for alternative or counterfactual "
        "explanations, and seek to generalize and replicate the findings."
    ),
    "mixed": (
        "Mixed methods research is an approach to inquiry involving collecting both "
        "quantitative and qualitative data, using a specific procedure or design, "
        "combining (or integrating) the two forms of data within the design, and "
        "drawing conclusions (metainferences) about the insight to emerge from the "
        "combined databases. This description emphasizes a methods perspective focused "
        "on understanding mixed methods research from its data collection, data analysis, "
        "and interpretation. Also, in mixed methods a researcher brings philosophical "
        "assumptions and theories that inform the conduct of the research."
