The ascendency of qualitative research,\nthe emergence of mixed methods approaches, and the growth of\nquantitative designs have created a need for this book’s unique\ncomparison of the three approaches to inquiry. This comparison\nbegins with preliminary philosophical assumptions for all three\napproaches, a review of the literature, an assessment of the use of\ntheory and conceptual frameworks in research approaches, and\nreflections about the importance of writing and ethics in scholarly\ninquiry. The book then addresses the key elements in the process of\ndesigning and conducting a research project: writing an introduction;\nstating a purpose or research aims for the study; identifying research\nquestions and hypotheses; and advancing methods and procedures\nfor data collection, analysis, and interpretation. At each step in this\nprocess, the reader is taken through qualitative, quantitative, and\nmixed methods approaches.\nAUDIENCE\nThis book is intended for students and faculty who seek assistance in\npreparing a plan, proposal, or research project for a scholarly journal\narticle, a dissertation, a thesis, or an application for funding. At a\nbroader level, the book may be useful as both a reference book and\na textbook for courses in research methods. To best take advantage\nof the design features in this book, the reader needs a basic\nfamiliarity with qualitative and quantitative research; however, terms\nwill be explained and defined and recommended strategies advanced\nfor those needing introductory assistance in the design process.\nHighlighted terms in the text and a glossary of the terms at the back\nof the book provide a working language for understanding research.\nThis book also is intended for a broad audience in the human, health,",

We hope that researchers in fields such as marketing,\nmanagement, criminal justice, communication studies, psychology,\nsociology, K–12 education, higher and postsecondary education,\nnursing, family medicine, health services research, global health,\nbehavioral health, urban studies, family research, and other fields of\nstudy will find this sixth edition useful.\nFORMAT\nIn each chapter, we share examples drawn from varied disciplines.\nWe drew examples from books, journal articles, dissertation\nproposals, and dissertations. Although our primary specializations are\neducational psychology, the health sciences, and psychology, the\nillustrations are inclusive of many fields. They reflect issues in social\njustice and examples of studies with marginalized individuals in our\nsociety as well as the traditional samples and populations studied by\nresearchers. Inclusiveness also extends to methodological pluralism\nin research today, and the discussion incorporates alternative\nphilosophical ideas, diverse modes of inquiry, and numerous\nprocedures.\nThis book is not a detailed method text; instead, we highlight the\nessential features of research design. We have attempted to reduce\nresearch to its core ideas so that researchers can plan a thorough\nand thoughtful study. The coverage of research designs is limited to\nfrequently used forms: surveys and experiments in quantitative\nresearch; narrative research, phenomenology, grounded theory,\nethnography, and case studies in qualitative research; and\nconvergent, explanatory sequential, and exploratory sequential\ndesigns in mixed methods research. Although students preparing a\ndissertation proposal should find this book helpful, topics related to\nthe politics of presenting and negotiating a study with review\ncommittees are addressed thoroughly in other texts.\nConsistent with accepted conventions of scholarly writing, we have\ntried to eliminate any words or examples that convey a discriminatory\n(e.g., sexist or ethnic) orientation. Examples were selected to provide\na full range of gender and cultural orientations. Throughout the text\nwe do not favor either qualitative or quantitative research. Indeed, we",

As with earlier editions,\nwe have maintained features to enhance the readability and\nunderstandability of the material: bullets to emphasize key points,\nnumbered points to stress key steps in a process, and longer\nexamples of complete passages with annotations to highlight key\nresearch ideas.\nNEW FEATURES IN THE SIXTH EDITION\nIn this sixth edition of the book, we have added new features in\nresponse to reviewers’ comments and emerging trends in research\nmethods:\nWe offer more inclusive and supportive language in our\ndiscussions throughout the book.\nNew tables and figures clarify content, such as the difference\nbetween a research problem, a purpose or aim, and a research\nquestion.\nResearch methods is a living and evolving science. We updated\nthe text to capture new trends and include new references to\nbring a state-of-the-art discussion to the book.\nEach chapter now begins with learning objectives.\nWe have reorganized and added a number of new features to\nthe quantitative methods chapter.\nThe structure of the three methods chapters—quantitative,\nqualitative, and mixed methods—now show a similar and\nconsistent sequence of method topics.\nAs in previous editions, we alternate starting with quantitative\nresearch and then qualitative research to give preference to both\napproaches.",

        "text": "Part I. Preliminary Considerations\nThis part of the book discusses preparing for the design of a\nscholarly study. It contains Chapters 1 through 4.\nChapter 1. The Selection of a Research Approach\nIn this chapter, we begin by defining quantitative, qualitative, and\nmixed methods approaches. We then discuss how philosophy,\ndesigns, and methods intersect when one uses one of these\napproaches. We review different philosophical stances (postpositivist,\nconstructivist, transformative, and pragmatic); advance types of\nqualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods designs; and then\ndiscuss the methods associated with each design. We also consider\nthe factors for choosing an approach to research. Thus, this chapter\nshould help proposal developers decide whether a qualitative,\nquantitative, or mixed methods approach is suitable for their\nproposed research project.\nChapter 2. Review of the Literature\nIt is important to extensively review the literature on your topic before\nyou design your proposal. Thus, you need to begin with a\nresearchable topic and a draft topic and then explore the literature\nusing the steps advanced in this chapter. Realize that literature\nreviews differ for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods\nprojects. The steps call for searching the literature, using\ncomputerized databases, locating a small number of studies to\nreview, evaluating the quality of the information sources, developing a\nliterature map, and assembling a summary of the literature. This\nchapter should help researchers thoughtfully consider relevant\nliterature on their topics and start compiling and writing literature\nreviews.\nChapter 3. The Use of Theory",

        "text": "Theories serve different purposes in the three approaches inquiry. In\nquantitative research, they provide a proposed explanation for the\nrelationship among variables tested by the investigator. Different\ntypes of quantitative variables are related in theories and often\npresented as causal models indicating a time ordering. In qualitative\nresearch, they may often serve as a lens for the inquiry, or they may\nbe generated during the study. In mixed methods studies,\nresearchers employ them in many ways, including those associated\nwith quantitative and qualitative approaches. This chapter helps\nresearchers consider and plan how to incorporate theory into their\nstudies.\nChapter 4. Writing Strategies and Ethical\nConsiderations\nIt is helpful to have an overall outline of topics in a proposal or\nresearch study before you begin writing. Thus, this chapter begins\nwith a general model of questions addressed in a good proposal. It\nthen presents the structure of a proposal for a qualitative,\nquantitative, and mixed methods study with different outlines for\nwriting proposals. Writing clearly and concisely is a necessary part of\na good proposal, and the discussion turns to writing strategies. The\nact of writing helps researchers think through a project. The project\nneeds to be easy to read, coherent with sections tied together, and\ngrammatically correct. Ethical issues that arise in projects also need\nattention. Strategies need to be developed to attend to issues arising\nprior to and during the conduct of the study. Ethical issues also arise\nin the reporting and dissemination of a study.",

        "text": "PART II. DESIGNING RESEARCH\nIn Part II, we turn to the components of designing the research\nproposal. Chapters 5 through 10 address steps in this process.\nChapter 5. The Introduction\nIt is important to properly introduce a research study. We provide a\nmodel for writing a good scholarly introduction to your proposal. The\nchapter begins with designing an abstract for a study. This is followed\nby developing an introduction to include identifying the research\nproblem or issue, framing this problem within the existing literature,\npointing out deficiencies in the literature, and targeting the study for\nan audience. This chapter provides a systematic method for\ndesigning a scholarly introduction to a proposal or study.\nChapter 6. The Purpose Statement\nAt the beginning of research proposals or projects, authors mention\nthe central purpose or study aim. This passage is the most important\nstatement in the entire research process, and an entire chapter is\ndevoted to this topic. In this chapter, you learn how to write this\nstatement for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies.\nScripts, to be filled in with your project, provide practical statements\nthat will ease your process of designing a proposal or a research\nstudy.\nChapter 7. Research Questions and Hypotheses\nThe questions and hypotheses addressed by the researcher serve to\nnarrow and focus the purpose of the study. As a major signpost in a\nproject, research questions and hypotheses need to be written\ncarefully. In this chapter, you will learn how to write both qualitative\nand quantitative research questions and hypotheses as well as how\nto employ both forms in writing mixed methods questions and\nhypotheses. Numerous examples serve as scripts to illustrate these\nprocesses.",

        "text": "Chapter 8. Quantitative Methods\nQuantitative methods involve the processes of collecting, analyzing,\ninterpreting, and writing the results of a study. Specific methods exist\nin both survey and experimental research that relate to identifying a\nsample and population, specifying the type of design, collecting and\nanalyzing data, presenting the results, making an interpretation, and\nwriting the research in a manner consistent with a survey or\nexperimental study. In this chapter, the reader learns the specific\nprocedures for designing survey or experimental methods that need\nto go into a research proposal. This chapter provides checklists to\nensure the inclusion of all steps.\nChapter 9. Qualitative Methods\nQualitative approaches to data collection, analysis, interpretation, and\nreport writing differ from the traditional, quantitative approaches.\nPurposeful sampling, open-ended data collection, text or images\nanalysis (e.g., pictures), figures and tables, representations, and\npersonal interpretations of the findings all inform qualitative methods.\nThis chapter advances steps in designing qualitative procedures into\na research proposal, and it also includes a checklist for making sure\nthat you cover important procedures. Ample illustrations provide\nexamples from narrative studies, phenomenology, grounded theory,\nethnography, case studies, and descriptive studies.\nChapter 10. Mixed Methods Procedures\nMixed methods research involves the collection and “mixing” or\nintegration of both quantitative and qualitative data in a study. It is not\nenough to only analyze your qualitative and quantitative data. Further\nanalysis comprises integrating the two databases for additional\ninsight into research problems and questions. Mixed methods\nresearch has increased in popularity in recent years, and this chapter\nhighlights important developments and introduces the use of this\ndesign. This chapter begins by defining mixed methods research and\nthe core characteristics that describe it. Then it takes the reader\nthrough the process of designing a method section for a proposal or\nplan. This process involves collecting both quantitative (closed-ended)",

This is followed by identifying a mixed methods design\nwith the intent and procedures to integrate the two databases. We\ndiscuss three core designs and four complex designs. To analyze the\nintegration we suggest using a joint display that arrays the\nquantitative and qualitative data or results in a table. Then\nresearchers examine the table and draw inferences or insight from\nintegrating the two databases. Choosing a mixed methods design\ninvolves considering the intent and the procedures for integrating the\ndata. Flowcharts in the chapter help researchers decide on an\nappropriate mixed methods design for their studies.\nDesigning a study is a difficult and time-consuming process. This\nbook will not necessarily make the process easier or faster, but it can\nprovide specific skills useful in research, knowledge about the steps\ninvolved in the process, and a practical guide to composing and\nwriting scholarly research. Before the steps of the process unfold, we\nrecommend that proposal developers think through their approaches\nto research, conduct literature reviews on their topics, develop an\noutline of topics to include in a proposal design, and begin anticipating\npotential ethical issues that may arise in the research.",

Describe the relationship among the terms, philosophical worldview assumptions, designs,\nand methods. How would you connect these three components in your study?\n4.

Identify the reasons for choosing either a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods approach\nto use in your study.\nINTRODUCING KEY TERMS IN THIS CHAPTER\nResearch has its own language, and it is important to understand key terms to use in a study. The title of\nthis book uses the term, research approaches. Research approaches (or methodologies) are\nprocedures for research that span the steps from broad assumptions to detailed methods of data\ncollection, analysis, and interpretation. This plan involves several decisions, and researchers need not\ntake them in the order in which they are presented here. The overall decision involves which approach\nshould be used to study a topic. Informing this decision should be the philosophical assumptions the\nresearcher brings to the study; procedures of inquiry (called research designs); and specific research\nmethods of data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The selection of a research approach includes\nthe research problem or issue being addressed, the researchers’ personal experiences, and the\naudiences for the study. Thus, in this book, philosophical assumptions, research approaches, research\ndesigns, and research methods are four key terms representing a perspective about research flow from\nbroad constructions of research to the narrow procedures of methods. Table 1.1 explains these key\nterms in more detail.\nTable 1.1 Key Terms and Their Definitions as Used in This Chapter",

        "text": "categories, opposites, or dichotomies. Instead, they represent different ends on a continuum (Creswell &\nGuetterman, 2018; Newman & Benz, 1998). A study tends to be more qualitative than quantitative or vice\nversa. Mixed methods research resides in the middle of this continuum because it incorporates elements\nof both qualitative and quantitative approaches.\nOften the distinction between qualitative research and quantitative research is framed in terms of using\nwords (qualitative) rather than numbers (quantitative) or, better yet, using closed-ended questions and\nresponses (quantitative hypotheses) or open-ended questions and responses (qualitative interview\nquestions). A more complete way to view the gradations of differences between them is found in the\nbasic philosophical assumptions researchers bring to the study, the types of research strategies used in\nthe research (e.g., quantitative experiments or qualitative case studies), and the specific methods\nemployed in conducting these strategies (e.g., collecting data quantitatively on instruments versus\ncollecting qualitative data through observing a setting). Moreover, there is a historical evolution to both\napproaches—with the quantitative approaches dominating the forms of research in the social sciences\nfrom the late 19th century until the mid-20th century. During the latter half of the 20th century, interest in\nqualitative research increased and mixed methods research developed. With this background, it should\nprove helpful to view definitions of these three key terms as used in this book:\nQualitative research is an approach for exploring and understanding the meaning individuals or\ngroups ascribe to a social or human problem. The research process involves emerging questions and\nprocedures, data typically collected in the participant’s setting, data analysis inductively building from\nparticulars to general themes, and the researcher making interpretations of the meaning of the data.\nThe final written report has a flexible structure. Those who engage in this form of inquiry use an\ninductive style building from data to themes and a focus on individual meaning, and emphasize the\nimportance of reporting the complexity of a situation.\nQuantitative research is an approach for testing objective theories by examining the relationship\namong variables or a comparison among groups. These variables, in turn, can be measured,\ntypically on instruments, so that numbered data can be analyzed using statistical procedures. The\nfinal written report has a set structure comprising an introduction, methods, results, and discussion.\nQuantitative researchers test theories deductively, build into a study protections against bias, control\nfor alternative or counterfactual explanations, and seek to generalize and replicate the findings.\nMixed methods research is an approach to inquiry involving collecting both quantitative and\nqualitative data, using a specific procedure or design, combining (or integrating) the two forms of\ndata within the design, and drawing conclusions (metainferences) about the insight to emerge from\nthe combined databases. This description emphasizes a methods perspective focused on\nunderstanding mixed methods research from its data collection, data analysis, and interpretation.\nAlso, in mixed methods a researcher brings philosophical assumptions and theories that inform the\nconduct of the research.\nTHREE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF A RESEARCH APPROACH\nThe broad research approach is the plan or proposal to conduct research, involving the intersection of\nphilosophy, research designs, and specific methods. Figure 1.1 presents a framework that we use to\nexplain the interaction of these three components. In planning a study, researchers need to think through\nthe philosophical worldview assumptions that they bring to the study, the research design that is related\nto this worldview, and the specific methods or procedures of research that translate the approach into\npractice.",

We suggest that individuals preparing a research\nproposal or plan make the larger philosophical ideas they espouse explicit. This information will help\nexplain why they chose qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods approaches for their research. In\nwriting about worldviews, a proposal might include a section that addresses the following:\nThe philosophical worldview being used by the researcher\nA definition of basic ideas of that worldview\nAn individual’s worldview drawn on research experiences, training, or cultural environment\nHow the worldview shaped their approach to research\nWe have chosen to use the term worldview as meaning “a basic set of beliefs that guide action” (Guba,\n1990, p. 17). Others have called them paradigms (Lincoln et al., 2011; Mertens, 2010); epistemologies\nand ontologies (Crotty, 1998), or broadly conceived research methodologies (Neuman, 2009). We\nprefer the word “worldview” because it brings a global perspective to research in this era of international\ninterconnections. We see worldviews as a general philosophical orientation about the world and the\nnature of research that a researcher brings to a study.\nIndividuals develop worldviews based on their discipline orientations and research communities, advisers\nand mentors, past research experiences, and cultural experiences. Individual researchers’ beliefs based\non these factors will often lead to embracing a strong qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods\napproach in their research. The philosophical beliefs are important to include in a study because a reader\ncan best interpret the research knowing the biases and the particular stance being taken by the\nresearcher. We recognize that in quantitative research the position of the researcher remains largely\nhidden and not expressed; still we feel that it needs to be presented in the open for readers to interpret a\nstudy.\nAlthough there is ongoing debate about what worldviews or beliefs researchers bring to inquiry, we will\nhighlight four widely discussed in the literature: postpositivism, constructivism, transformative, and\npragmatism. The major elements of each position are presented in Table 1.2.\nTable 1.2 Four Worldviews",

This worldview is sometimes called the\nscientific method or doing science research. It is also called positivist/postpositivist research, empirical\nscience, and postpositivism. This last term is called postpositivism because it represents the thinking\nafter positivism, challenging the traditional notion of the absolute truth of knowledge (Phillips & Burbules,\n2000) and recognizing that we cannot be certain about our claims of knowledge when studying the\nbehavior and actions of humans. The postpositivist tradition comes from 19th-century writers such as\nComte, Mill, Durkheim, Newton, and Locke (Smith, 1983) and more recently from writers such as Phillips\nand Burbules (2000).\nThose who hold a postpositivist worldview hold a deterministic philosophy that causes (probably)\ndetermine effects or outcomes. Thus, the problems studied by postpositivists reflect the need to identify\nand assess the causes that influence outcomes, such as those found in experiments.

        "text": "variables that comprise hypotheses and research questions. Careful observation and measurement of the\nobjective reality “out there” in the world represent a postpositivist lens. Thus, developing numeric\nmeasures of observations and studying the behavior of individuals become paramount for a postpositivist.\nFinally, laws or theories govern the world, and these theories need to be tested, verified, and refined so\nthat we can understand the world. Thus, in the scientific method—the accepted approach to research by\npostpositivists—a researcher begins with a theory, collects data that either supports or refutes the\ntheory, and then makes necessary revisions and conducts additional tests.\nIn reading Phillips and Burbules (2000), you can gain a sense of the key assumptions of this position,\nsuch as the following:\nKnowledge is conjectural (and antifoundational)—absolute truth can never be found.\nThus, evidence established in research is always imperfect and fallible. For this reason, researchers\nstate that they do not prove a hypothesis; instead, they indicate a failure to reject the hypothesis.\nResearch is the process of making claims and then refining or abandoning some of them for other\nclaims more strongly warranted. Most quantitative research, for example, starts with the test of a\ntheory.\nData, evidence, and rational considerations shape knowledge. In practice, the researcher collects\ninformation on instruments based on measures completed by the participants or by observations\nrecorded by the researcher.\nResearch seeks to develop relevant, true statements that explain the situation of concern or that\ndescribe the causal relationships of interest. In quantitative studies, researchers advance the\nrelationships among variables and pose these as questions or hypotheses.\nBeing objective is an essential aspect of competent inquiry; researchers must examine methods and\nconclusions for bias. For example, standards of validity and reliability are important in quantitative\nresearch.\nThe Constructivist Worldview\nOthers hold a different worldview. A constructivist or social constructivist worldview (often combined with\ninterpretivism) is a philosophical position used in qualitative research. The ideas came from Mannheim\nand from works such as Berger and Luckmann’s (1967) The Social Construction of Reality and Lincoln\nand Guba’s (1985) Naturalistic Inquiry. More recent writers who have summarized this position are\nLincoln et al. (2011), Mertens (2010), and Crotty (1998), among others. Those who hold a\nconstructivist worldview believe that individuals seek understanding of the world in which they live and\nwork. Individuals develop subjective meanings of their experiences—meanings directed toward certain\nobjects or things. These meanings are varied and multiple, leading the researcher to look for the\ncomplexity of views rather than narrowing meanings into a few categories or ideas. The goal of the\nresearch relies as much as possible on the participants’ views of the situation. The questions become\nbroad and general so that the participants can construct the meaning of a situation, typically forged in\ndiscussions or interactions with other persons. The more open-ended the questioning, the better because\nthe researcher listens carefully to what people say or do in their life settings. Often these subjective\nmeanings are negotiated socially and historically. They are not simply imprinted on individuals but are\nformed through interaction with others (hence social constructivism) and through historical and cultural\nnorms that operate in individuals’ lives. Thus, constructivist researchers often address the processes of\ninteraction among individuals. They also focus on the specific contexts in which people live and work to\nunderstand the historical and cultural settings of the participants. Researchers recognize that their own\nbackgrounds shape their interpretations, and they position themselves in the research to acknowledge\nhow their interpretations flow from their personal, cultural, and historical experiences. The researcher’s\nintent is to make sense of (or interpret) the meanings others have about the world. Rather than starting\nwith a theory (as in postpositivism), inquirers generate or inductively develop a theory or pattern of\nmeaning.\nFor example, in discussing constructivism, Crotty (1998) identified several assumptions:",

        "text": "Human beings construct meanings as they engage with the world they are interpreting. Qualitative\nresearchers tend to use open-ended questions so that the participants can share their views.\nHumans engage with their world and make sense of it based on their historical and social\nperspectives—we are all born into a world of meaning bestowed upon us by our culture. Thus,\nqualitative researchers seek to understand the context or setting of the participants through visiting\nthis context and gathering information personally. They also interpret what they find, an interpretation\nshaped by the researcher’s own experiences and background.\nThe basic generation of meaning is always social, arising in and out of interaction with a human\ncommunity. The process of qualitative research is largely inductive; the inquirer generates meaning\nfrom the data collected in the field.\nThe Transformative Worldview\nAnother group of researchers holds to the philosophical assumptions of the transformative approach. This\nposition arose during the 1980s and 1990s from individuals who felt that the postpositivist assumptions\nimposed structural laws and theories that did not fit marginalized individuals in our society or issues of\npower and social justice, discrimination, and oppression. There is no uniform body of literature\ncharacterizing this worldview, but it includes groups of researchers that are critical theorists, participatory\naction researchers, community-based participatory researchers, Marxists, feminists, and racial and ethnic\nminorities. It also includes persons with disabilities, indigenous and postcolonial peoples, and members of\nthe lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, and queer communities. Historically, the transformative writers\nhave drawn on the works of Marx, Adorno, Marcuse, Habermas, and Freire (Neuman, 2009). Fay (1987),\nHeron and Reason (1997), Kemmis and Wilkinson (1998), Kemmis and McTaggart (2000), and Mertens\n(2009, 2010) are additional authors writing about this perspective.\nIn the main, these inquirers felt that the constructivist stance did not go far enough in advocating for an\naction agenda to help marginalized people. A transformative worldview holds that research inquiry\nneeds to be intertwined with politics and a political change agenda to confront social oppression at\nwhatever levels it occurs (Mertens, 2010). Thus, the research contains an action agenda for reform that\nmay change the lives of the participants, the institutions in which individuals work or live, and the\nresearcher’s life. Moreover, researchers need to address specific important social issues of the day,\nissues such as empowerment, inequality, oppression, domination, suppression, and alienation. The\nresearcher often begins with one of these issues as the focal point of the study. This research also\nassumes that the inquirer will proceed collaboratively to not further marginalize the participants as a result\nof the inquiry. In this sense, the participants may help design questions, collect data, analyze information,\nor reap the rewards of the research. Transformative research provides a voice for these participants,\nraising their consciousness or advancing an agenda for change to improve their lives. It becomes a united\nvoice for reform and change.\nThis philosophical worldview focuses on the needs of groups and individuals in our society that may be\nmarginalized or disenfranchised. Therefore, theoretical perspectives may be integrated with philosophical\nassumptions that construct a picture of the issues being examined, the people studied, and the changes\nneeded, such as in feminist perspectives, racialized discourses, critical theory, queer theory, and\ndisability theory. An important development around the world has been the expansion of interest in\nindigenous methodologies that respect and honor the culture of individuals being studied. For example, in\na study in Botswana, Chilisa and Tsheko (2014) discussed the importance of attending to cultural\nlanguage of participants (e.g., gestures, tones, expressions) and using conversational modes of data\ncollection (e.g., talking circles, storying). Also important is seeking out “knowers” of the language for\nproverbs, myths, and folktales, including participants as co-researchers, and engaging in respectful\nprinciples of accountability toward the participants.\nAlthough these are diverse groups and our explanations here are generalizations, it is helpful to view the\nsummary by Mertens (2010) of key features of the transformative worldview or paradigm:\nIt places central importance on the study of lives and experiences of diverse groups that have\ntraditionally been marginalized. For these groups, their lives have been constrained by oppressors,\nleading to strategies to resist, challenge, and subvert these constraints.",

        "text": "In studying these diverse groups, the researcher focuses on inequities based on gender, race,\nethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic class that result in asymmetric power\nrelationships.\nThe research in the transformative worldview links political and social action to these inequities.\nTransformative research uses a program theory of beliefs about how a program works and why the\nproblems of oppression, domination, and power relationships exist.\nThe Pragmatic Worldview\nAnother position about worldviews comes from the pragmatists. Pragmatism derives from the work of\nPeirce, James, Mead, and Dewey (Cherryholmes, 1992). Other writers include Murphy (1990), Patton\n(1990), and Rorty (1990). There are many forms of a pragmatic worldview, but it arises out of actions,\nsituations, and consequences rather than antecedent conditions (as in postpositivism). There is a concern\nwith applications—what works—and solutions to problems (Patton, 1990). Instead of focusing on\nmethods, researchers emphasize the research problem and question and use all approaches available to\nunderstand the problem (see Rossman & Wilson, 1985). As a philosophical underpinning for mixed\nmethods studies, Morgan (2007), Patton (1990), and Tashakkori and Teddlie (2010) convey its\nimportance for focusing attention on the research problem in social science research and then using\npluralistic approaches to gather data about the problem. Using Cherryholmes (1992), Morgan (2007),\nand our own views, pragmatism provides a philosophical basis for research:\nPragmatism is not committed to any one system of philosophy and reality. This idea applies to mixed\nmethods research in that inquirers draw liberally from both quantitative and qualitative assumptions\nwhen they engage in their research.\nIndividual researchers have a freedom of choice. In this way, researchers are free to choose the\nmethods, techniques, and procedures of research that best meet their needs and purposes.\nPragmatists do not see the world as an absolute unity. In a similar way, mixed methods researchers\nlook to many approaches for collecting and analyzing data rather than subscribing to only one way\n(e.g., quantitative or qualitative).\nTruth is what works at the time. It is not based in a duality between reality independent of the mind\nor within the mind. Thus, in mixed methods research, investigators use both quantitative and\nqualitative data because they provide the best understanding of a research problem.\nThe pragmatist researchers look to the what and how to research based on the intended\nconsequences. Mixed methods researchers need to establish a purpose for their mixing, a rationale\nfor reasons why quantitative and qualitative data need to be mixed in the first place.\nPragmatists agree that research always occurs in social, historical, political, and other contexts. In\nthis way, mixed methods studies may include a postmodern turn, a theoretical lens that reflects\nsocial justice and political aims.\nPragmatists believe in an external world independent of the mind as well as that lodged in the mind.\nBut they believe that we need to stop asking questions about reality and the laws of nature\n(Cherryholmes, 1992). “They would simply like to change the subject” (Rorty, 1990, p. xiv).\nThus, for the mixed methods researcher, pragmatism opens the door to multiple methods, different\nworldviews, assumptions, and forms of data collection and analysis.\nResearch Designs\nOf the three-part framework—philosophical assumptions, research designs, and research methods—our\nfocus now turns to the second element, the research designs. The researcher not only selects a\nqualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods study to conduct; the inquirer also decides on a type of study\ndesign within these three choices. Research designs are types of inquiry within qualitative, quantitative,\nand mixed methods approaches that provide specific direction for procedures in a research study. Others",

The designs available to the researcher\nhave grown over the years as computer technology has advanced our data analysis, our ability to analyze\ncomplex models, and our capacity to engage in new procedures for conducting social science research.\nSelect types will be emphasized in the methods discussions of Chapters 8, 9, and 10, types frequently\nused in the social and health sciences. Here we introduce the designs that will be discussed later and that\nare cited in examples throughout the book. An overview of these designs is shown in Table 1.3.\nTable 1.3 Alternative Research Designs\nQualitative\nQuantitative Designs Methods Designs\nDesigns\nExperimental and quasi- Descriptive Convergent\nexperimental method\nExplanatory sequential\nSingle-subject Narrative\nresearch Exploratory sequential\nNonexperimental such as\nsurveys Phenomenology Complex designs with embedded\ncore designs\nLongitudinal Grounded\ntheory\nEthnography\nCase study\nQuantitative Designs\nDuring the late 19th and throughout the 20th century, designs associated with quantitative research\ninvoked the postpositivist worldview and originated mainly in physiology and psychology. These include\ntrue experiments and quasi-experiments (see an original, early treatise on this, Campbell & Stanley,\n1963). An additional experimental design is applied behavioral analysis or single-subject experiments.\nThis type of experiment involves a treatment administered over time to a single individual or a small\nnumber of individuals (Cooper et al., 2007; Neuman & McCormick, 1995). One type of nonexperimental\nquantitative research is causal-comparative research. The investigator compares two or more groups in\nterms of a cause (or independent variable) that has already happened. Another nonexperimental form of\nresearch is the correlational design in which investigators use the correlational statistic to describe and\nmeasure the degree or association (or relationship) between two or more variables or sets of scores\n(Creswell & Guetterman, 2018). These designs involve more complex relationships among variables\nfound in techniques of structural equation modeling, hierarchical linear modeling, and logistic regression.\nMore recently, quantitative strategies have involved complex experiments with many variables and\ntreatments (e.g., factorial designs and repeated measure designs). Designs often employ longitudinal\ndata collection over time to examine the development of ideas and trends. Designs have also included\nelaborate structural equation models that incorporate causal paths and the identification of the collective\nstrength of multiple variables. Rather than discuss these quantitative approaches, we will focus in this\nbook on two primary designs: surveys and experiments.",

        "text": "Survey research provides a quantitative or numeric description of a population’s trends, attitudes,\nor opinions by studying a sample of that population. It includes cross-sectional and longitudinal\nstudies using questionnaires or structured interviews for data collection to generalize from a sample\nto a population (Fowler, 2008).\nExperimental research seeks to determine if a specific treatment influences an outcome. The\nresearcher assesses this by providing a specific treatment to one group, withholding it from another,\nand then determining how both groups scored on an outcome. Experiments include true experiments,\nthe random assignment of subjects to treatment conditions, and quasi-experiments that use\nnonrandomized assignments (Keppel, 1991). Included experiments are single-subject designs in\nwhich a single individual or group is observed over a period of time and interventions administered\nand then withheld (Gast & Ledford, 2014).\nQualitative Designs\nIn qualitative research, the numbers and types of approaches have also become more clearly visible\nduring the 1990s and into the 21st century. The historic origin for qualitative research comes from\nanthropology, sociology, the humanities, and evaluation. Books have summarized the various types, and\ncomplete procedures are now available on specific qualitative inquiry approaches (Creswell & Poth,\n2018). For example, Clandinin and Connelly (2000) constructed a picture of what narrative researchers\ndo. Moustakas (1994) discussed the philosophical tenets and the procedures of the phenomenological\nmethod; Charmaz (2006), Corbin and Strauss (2007, 2015), and Strauss and Corbin (1990, 1998)\nidentified the procedures of grounded theory. Fetterman (2010) and Wolcott (2008) summarized\nethnographic procedures and the many faces and research strategies of ethnography, and Stake (1995)\nand Yin (2009, 2012, 2014) suggested processes involved in case study research. In this book,\nillustrations are drawn from the following qualitative designs, recognizing that approaches such as\nparticipatory action research (Kemmis & McTaggart, 2000), discourse analysis (Cheek, 2004), and\nothers not mentioned are also viable ways to conduct qualitative studies:\nDescriptive method in qualitative research is an approach to analysis where the researcher stays\nclose to the data, uses limited frameworks and interpretation for explaining the data, and catalogues\nthe information into themes.\nNarrative research is a design of inquiry from the humanities in which the researcher studies the\nlives of individuals and asks one or more participants to provide stories about their lives (Riessman,\n2008). This information is then often retold or restoried by the researcher into a narrative chronology.\nOften, in the end, the narrative combines views from the participant’s life with those of the\nresearcher’s life in a collaborative narrative (Clandinin & Connelly, 2000).\nPhenomenological research is a design of inquiry coming from philosophy and psychology in which\nthe researcher describes the lived experiences of individuals about a phenomenon as described by\nparticipants. This description culminates in the essence of several individuals who have all\nexperienced the phenomenon. This design has strong philosophical underpinnings and typically\ninvolves conducting interviews (Giorgi, 2009; Moustakas, 1994).\nGrounded theory is a design of inquiry from sociology in which the researcher derives a general,\nabstract theory of a process, action, or interaction grounded in the views of participants. This\nprocess involves using multiple stages of data collection and the refinement and interrelationship of\ncategories of information to form a theory (Charmaz, 2006; Corbin & Strauss, 2007, 2015).\nEthnography is a design of inquiry coming from anthropology and sociology. The researcher studies\nthe shared patterns of behaviors, language, and actions of an intact cultural group in a natural setting\nover a prolonged period of time. Data collection often involves observations and interviews (Wolcott,\n1994).\nCase studies are a design of inquiry found in many fields, especially evaluation, in which the\nresearcher develops an in-depth analysis of a case, often a program, event, activity, process, or one\nor more individuals. Cases are bounded by time and place (or setting), and researchers collect\ndetailed information using a variety of data collection procedures over a sustained period of time\n(Stake, 1995; Yin, 2009, 2012, 2014).",

        "text": "Mixed Methods Designs\nMixed methods research involves collecting quantitative and qualitative data and combining or integrating\nthe data to yield insights or inferences from the combined data. Qualitative data tends to be open-ended\nwithout predetermined responses, whereas quantitative data usually includes closed-ended responses\nsuch as those found on questionnaires or psychological instruments. As we know it today, the field of\nmixed methods research began in the middle to late 1980s. Its origins, however, go back further. In 1959,\nCampbell and Fisk used multiple methods to study psychological traits—although their methods were only\nquantitative measures. Their work prompted others to collect multiple forms of data, such as\nobservations and interviews (qualitative data) with traditional surveys (Sieber, 1973). Early thoughts\nabout the value of multiple methods—called mixed methods—resided in the idea that all methods had\nbias and weaknesses. The collection of both quantitative and qualitative data neutralized the weaknesses\nof each form of data. Combining data sources—a means for seeking convergence across qualitative and\nquantitative methods—was born (Jick, 1979). By the early 1990s, mixed methods turned toward the\nsystematic integration of quantitative and qualitative data and the idea of ways to combine the data\nthrough different types of research designs. These types of designs were extensively discussed in a\nmajor handbook addressing the field in 2003 and reissued in 2010 (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010).\nAs the field developed, specific mixed methods designs emerged complete with diagrams to help the\nreader understand the designs (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Creswell, 2022). Practical issues are\nbeing widely discussed today in terms of examples of “good” mixed methods studies and evaluative\ncriteria, the use of teams to conduct this form of inquiry, and the expansion of mixed methods worldwide.\nAlthough many designs exist in the mixed methods field, this book will focus on the three primary designs,\ncalled core design, and several complex designs that involve the embedding of core designs into\nprocesses or frameworks.\nA convergent mixed methods design is a core form of mixed methods design. The researcher\nconverges or merges quantitative and qualitative data to provide a comprehensive analysis of the\nresearch problem. In this design, the investigator typically collects both forms of data at roughly the\nsame time and then integrates the information in the interpretation of the overall results.\nContradictions or incongruent findings are explained or further probed in this design.\nAn explanatory sequential mixed methods design is a core design in which the researcher first\nconducts quantitative research, analyzes the results, and then builds on the results to explain them in\nmore detail with qualitative research. It is considered explanatory because the initial quantitative data\nresults are explained further with the qualitative data. It has a sequential structure because the initial\nquantitative phase follows the qualitative phase. This type of design is popular in fields with a strong\nquantitative orientation (because the project begins with quantitative research), but it presents\nchallenges of identifying the quantitative results and explaining the sample selection process in the\nstudy.\nAn exploratory sequential mixed methods design is the reverse sequence from the explanatory\nsequential design. In the exploratory sequential design the researcher first begins with a qualitative\nresearch phase and explores the views of participants. The data are then analyzed and the\ninformation used to build into a second, quantitative phase. The qualitative phase may be used in\nseveral ways. It can help build an instrument that best fits the sample under study, identify\nappropriate instruments to use in the follow-up quantitative phase, and develop an intervention for an\nexperiment. The qualitative phase can also help design an app or website or to specify variables that\nneed to go into a follow-up quantitative study. Challenges to this design reside in focusing in on the\nappropriate qualitative findings to use in the quantitative design and the sample selection for both\nphases of research.\nA complex mixed methods design involves embedding one or more core designs into a framework\nor a process. For example, the core designs can augment an experiment by collecting qualitative\ndata after the experiment to help explain the quantitative outcome results. The core designs can be\nused within a case study framework to deductively document cases or to generate cases for further\nanalysis. The core designs can inform a theoretical study drawn from social justice (see Chapter 3)\nas an overarching perspective within a design that contains both quantitative and qualitative data.\nThe core designs can also be used in the different phases of an evaluation procedure that spans\nfrom a needs assessment to a test of a program or experimental intervention.",

        "text": "Research Methods\nThe third major element in the philosophy-design-methods framework is the specific research methods\nthat involve the forms of data collection, analysis, and interpretation that researchers propose for their\nstudies. As shown in Table 1.4, it is useful to consider the full range of possibilities of data collection and\nto organize these methods, for example, by their degree of predetermined nature, their use of closed-\nended versus open-ended questioning, and their focus on numeric versus nonnumeric data analysis.\nThese methods will be developed further in Chapters 8 through 10.\nResearchers collect data on an instrument or test (e.g., a set of questions about attitudes toward self-\nesteem) or gather information on a behavioral checklist (e.g., observation of a worker engaged in a\ncomplex skill). On the other end of the continuum, collecting data might involve visiting a research site and\nobserving the behavior of individuals without predetermined questions or conducting an interview in which\nthe individual talks openly about a topic, largely without the use of specific questions. The choice of\nmethods turns on whether the intent is to specify the type of information to be collected in advance of the\nstudy or to allow it to emerge from participants in the project. Also, the type of data analyzed may be\nnumeric information gathered on scales of instruments or text information recording and reporting the\nvoice of the participants. Researchers make interpretations of the statistical results, or they interpret the\nthemes or patterns that emerge from the data. In some forms of research, both quantitative and\nqualitative data are collected, analyzed, and interpreted. Instrument data may be augmented with open-\nended observations, or census data may be followed by in-depth exploratory interviews.

        "text": "INTERCONNECTING WORLDVIEWS, DESIGNS, AND METHODS\nThe worldviews, the designs, and the methods all contribute to a research approach that tends to be\nquantitative, qualitative, or mixed. Table 1.5 creates distinctions that may be useful in choosing an\napproach. This table also includes practices of all three approaches that we emphasize in the remaining\nchapters of this book.\nTypical scenarios of research can illustrate how these three elements combine into a research design.\nExample 1. Quantitative Approach: Postpositivist Worldview, Experimental Design, and Pretest\nand Posttest Measures of Attitudes\nIn this scenario, the researcher tests a theory by specifying narrow hypotheses and the\ncollection of data to support or refute the hypotheses. The researcher uses an experimental\ndesign to assess attitudes both before and after an experimental treatment. The data are\ncollected on an instrument that measures attitudes, and the information is analyzed using\nstatistical data analysis procedures and hypothesis testing.\nTable 1.5 Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches\nTends to or Quantitative\nQualitative Approaches Mixed Methods Approaches\nTypically Approaches\nUses these Constructivist/transformative Postpositivist Pragmatic knowledge claims\nphilosophical knowledge claims knowledge claims\nassumptions",

        "text": "Example 3. Qualitative Approach: Transformative Worldview, Narrative Design, and Open-Ended\nInterviewing\nFor this study, the inquirer seeks to examine an issue related to oppression of individuals. To study\nthis, the researcher collects stories about individual oppression using a narrative approach.\nIndividuals are interviewed to determine how they have personally experienced oppression.\nExample 4. Mixed Methods Approach: Pragmatic Worldview, Collection of Both Quantitative and\nQualitative Data Sequentially in the Design\nThe researcher bases the inquiry on the assumption that collecting diverse types of data best\nprovides a more complete understanding of a research problem than quantitative or qualitative data\nalone. The study begins with a broad survey to generalize results to a population and then, in a\nsecond phase, focuses on qualitative, open-ended interviews to collect detailed views from\nparticipants to help explain the initial quantitative survey.\nCRITERIA FOR SELECTING A RESEARCH APPROACH\nGiven the possibility of qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods approaches, what factors affect a\nchoice of one approach over another for the design of a proposal? To make this choice, we need to add\nto worldview, design, and methods the research problem, the personal experiences of the researcher,\nand the audience(s) for the report.\nThe Research Problem and Questions\nA research problem, more thoroughly discussed in Chapter 5, is an issue or concern that needs to be\naddressed (e.g., the issue of racial discrimination). The problem comes from voids, conflicts in research\nresults, and topics neglected in the literature. It also can arise from the need to emphasize the voice of\nmarginalized participants and real-life problems found in the workplace, the home, the community.\nCertain types of social research problems call for specific approaches. For example, if the problem\nrequires for (a) the identification of factors that influence an outcome, (b) the utility of an intervention, or\n(c) understanding the best predictors of outcomes, then a quantitative approach is best. It is also the\nbest approach to use to test a theory or explanation. On the other hand, if a concept or phenomenon\nneeds to be explored and understood because little research has been done on it or involves an\nunderstudied sample, it merits a qualitative approach. Qualitative research is especially useful when the\nresearcher does not know the important research questions or variables to examine. This type of\napproach may be needed because the topic is new, the subject has never been addressed with a certain\nsample or group of people, and existing theories do not apply with the sample or group under study\n(Morse, 1991). A mixed methods design is useful when the quantitative or qualitative approach, each by\nitself, is inadequate to study a research problem and the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative\nresearch (and its data) can provide the best understanding. For example, a researcher may want to\ngeneralize the findings to a population and develop a detailed view of the meaning of a phenomenon or\nconcept for individuals. In this research, the inquirer first explores to learn what variables to study and\nthen examines them with a large sample of individuals. Alternatively, researchers may first survey a large\nnumber of individuals and then follow up with a few participants to obtain their specific views and their\nvoices about the topic. In these situations, collecting both closed-ended quantitative data and open-ended\nqualitative data proves advantageous.\nPersonal Experiences\nResearchers’ personal training and experiences also influence their choice of approach. An individual\ntrained in technical, scientific writing, statistics, and computer statistical programs and familiar with\nquantitative journals in the library would most likely choose the quantitative design. In contrast, individuals\nwho enjoy writing in a storytelling or literary way, conducting personal interviews, or making up-close\nobservations may gravitate to the qualitative approach. The mixed methods researcher is an individual",

        "text": "familiar with both quantitative and qualitative research. This person also has the time and resources to\ncollect and analyze both quantitative and qualitative data.\nBecause quantitative studies are the traditional mode of research, carefully worked out procedures and\nrules exist for them. Researchers may be more comfortable with the highly structured procedures of\nquantitative research. Also, it can be uncomfortable for some individuals to challenge accepted\napproaches among some faculty by using qualitative and transformative approaches to inquiry. In\ncontrast, qualitative approaches allow room to be innovative and to work more within researcher-\ndesigned frameworks. They allow more creative, literary-style writing, a form that individuals may like to\nuse. For those researchers undertaking social justice or community involvement studies, a qualitative\napproach is typically best, although this form of research may also incorporate mixed methods designs.\nFor the mixed methods researcher, the project will take extra time because of the need to collect and\nanalyze both quantitative and qualitative data. It fits a person who enjoys and has the skills in quantitative,\nqualitative research, and mixed methods research.\nAudience\nFinally, researchers write for audiences that will accept their research. These audiences may be journal\neditors and readers, faculty committees, conference attendees, or colleagues in the field. Students\nshould consider the approaches typically supported and used by their advisers. The experiences of these\naudiences with quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods studies can shape the decision made about the\nchoice of design.\nSummary\nIn designing a research proposal or a research project, start by understanding the definitions for\nphilosophical assumptions, research approach (or methodology), research design, and research\nmethod. Understand that this book will address three broad approaches to inquiry: quantitative,\nqualitative, and mixed methods. Then, a framework is helpful to proceed with a study. This\nframework involves understanding the philosophical assumptions the researcher brings to a study;\nthe designs or procedures available in quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research; and\nthe specific methods to be used. In choosing a specific design for a project, consider these three\ncomponents. In addition, a choice of approach involves the research problem or issue being\nstudied, the personal experiences of the researcher, and the audience for whom the researcher\nwrites.\nKEY TERMS\nCase studies 15\nComplex mixed methods design 17\nConstructivist worldview 9\nConvergent mixed methods design 16\nDescriptive method 15\nEthnography 15\nExperimental research 14\nExplanatory sequential mixed methods design 16\nExploratory sequential mixed methods design 17\nGrounded theory 15",

Through two chapters, “What Is Postpositivism?” and\n“Philosophical Commitments of Postpositivist Researchers,” the authors advance major ideas\nabout postpositivism and differentiate it from positivism.

Explain how to evaluate literature for inclusion in a literature review.\n5. Identify the most frequently used style conventions from APA used in a research study.\n6. Identify the types of terms needing definition in a scholarly research report.\nINTRODUCTION\nBesides selecting a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods approach, a first step in conducting\nresearch is to identify a topic and review the literature written about it. This chapter continues the\ndiscussion about understanding preliminary considerations before launching into a proposal or project. It\nbegins with a discussion about selecting a topic by drafting a title for a study and then determining\nwhether the topic is significant. Then, the chapter addresses the purpose of a literature review and its\nstructural differences for a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods study. Next, the chapter addresses\ncriteria for evaluating the quality of the literature. We also present several steps typically undertaken by\nresearchers during the literature review process. Within these steps, the researcher searches databases,\nprioritizes the importance of literature, writes abstracts (or takes notes), and evaluates the quality of the\nliterature. A literature map can help organize the information. We also recommend following closely the\nAmerican Psychological Association Publication Manual (American Psychological Association, 2020) for\nimportant style guides and defining terms when they first appear in a proposal or study.\nTHE RESEARCH TOPIC\nBefore considering what literature to use in a project, identify a topic to study and reflect on whether it is\npractical and useful to undertake the study. The topic is the subject or subject matter of a proposed\nstudy, such as “faculty teaching,” “organizational creativity,” or “psychological stress.” Describe the topic\nin a few words or in a short phrase. The topic becomes the central idea to learn about or to explore in a\nstudy.\nA Draft Title\nThere are several ways that researchers gain some insight into their topics when they initially plan their\nresearch (we assume that the topic is chosen by the researcher and not by an adviser or committee\nmember). One way is to draft a brief working title to the study. We are surprised how often researchers\nfail to draft a title early in the development of their projects. In our opinion, the working or draft title\nbecomes a major road sign in research—a tangible idea that the researcher refocuses as the project\ngoes on (see Glesne, 2015; Glesne & Peshkin, 1992). It becomes an orienting device. We find that, in\nour research, this topic provides a central focus for the study and serves as an identifier for others\nreading or hearing about the subject. When students provide their research project ideas, we often ask\nthem to supply a working title if they do not already have one completed.\nHow would this working title be written? Try completing this sentence: “My study is about . . .” A\nresponse might be, “My study is about at-risk children in the junior high,” or “My study is about helping\ncollege faculty become better researchers.” Consider framing a response so that another scholar might\neasily grasp the meaning of the project. A common shortcoming of beginning researchers is stating their\ntitle in complex and erudite language. This perspective often results from reading published articles that\npresent a clean, clear message. However, like all research, they undergo extensive revisions before",

        "text": "being set in print. Good, sound research projects begin with straightforward, uncomplicated thoughts that\nreaders can easily understand. Think about a journal article that you have read recently. If it was easy\nand quick to read, it was likely written in general language understandable to many readers. It was\nstraightforward in overall design and conceptualization. As a project develops, it will become more\ncomplicated, but it should not start in a complex way.\nWilkinson (1991) provided useful advice for creating a title: Be brief and avoid wasting words. Eliminate\nunnecessary words, such as “An Approach to . . . ,” “A Study of . . . ,” and so forth. Use a single title or a\ndouble title. An example of a double title would be “An Ethnography: Understanding a Child’s Perception\nof War.” In addition to Wilkinson’s thoughts, consider a title no longer than 10 to 12 words, eliminate most\narticles and prepositions, and include the focus or topic of the study.\nIn addition to writing a draft title, another strategy for topic development is to pose the topic as a brief\nquestion. What question needs to be answered in the proposed study? A researcher might ask, “What\ntreatment is best for depression?” “What does it mean to be Arabic in U.S. society today?” “What brings\npeople to tourist sites in Hawaii?” When drafting questions, focus on the question’s key topic as the major\nsignpost, and consider how to refine the topic to be descriptive of the study (see Chapters 6 and 7 on the\npurpose statement and research questions and hypotheses).\nA Significant Topic\nActively elevating this topic to a research study calls for reflecting on whether the topic can and should\nbe researched. A topic can be researched if a researcher has participants willing to serve in the study. It\nalso can be researched if the investigator has resources such as collecting data over a sustained time\nand using available computer programs to help in the analysis of data.\nThe question of should is a more complex matter. Several factors go into this decision. Perhaps the most\nimportant is whether the topic adds to the pool of research knowledge in the literature available on the\ntopic. It might also replicate past studies, lift the voices of underrepresented groups or individuals, help\naddress social justice, or transform the ideas and beliefs of researchers.\nA first step in any project is to spend considerable time in the library examining the research on a topic.\nThis point cannot be overemphasized. Beginning researchers may advance a great study that is complete\nin every way, such as in the clarity of research questions, the comprehensiveness of data collection, and\nthe sophistication of statistical analysis. But the researcher may garner little support from faculty\ncommittees or conference planners because the study does not add anything new to the body of\nresearch. Ask, “How does this project contribute to the literature?” Consider how the study might address\nan unexamined topic, extend the discussion by incorporating new elements, or replicate (or repeat) a\nstudy in new situations or with new participants. Contributing to the literature may also mean how the\nstudy adds to an understanding of a theory or extends a theory (see Chapter 3). It can also mean\nproviding a new perspective or “angle” to the existing literature. For example, the new angle might be one\nof these:\nStudying an unusual location (e.g., rural America)\nExamining an unusual group of participants (e.g., refugees)\nTaking an unexpected perspective that reverses an expectation (e.g., why marriages do work rather\nthan do not work)\nProviding novel means of collecting data (e.g., collect sounds)\nPresenting results in unusual ways (e.g., graphs that depict geographical locations)\nStudying a timely topic (e.g., immigration issues) (Creswell & Bàez, 2020)\nThe issue of should the topic be studied also relates to whether anyone outside of the researcher’s own\nimmediate institution or environment would be interested in the topic. Given choosing a topic that might be\nof limited regional interest or one of national interest, we opt for the latter because it has wide appeal to\na broad audience. Journal editors, committee members, conference planners, and funding agencies can\nappreciate research that reaches a broad audience. Finally, the topic may relate to the researcher’s",

        "text": "personal goals. Consider the time it takes to complete a project, revise it, and disseminate the results. All\nresearchers should consider how the study and its heavy commitment of time will pay off. It may pay off\nin enhancing career goals, conducting more research, obtaining a future position, or advancing toward a\ndegree.\nBefore proceeding with a proposal or a study, one can weigh these factors and ask others for reactions\nto a topic. Seek reactions from colleagues, noted authorities in the field, academic advisers, and faculty\ncommittee members. We find it helpful to ask students to bring to us a one-page sketch of their proposed\nproject. This sketch includes information about the problem or issue, the central research question, the\ntypes of data collected, and the overall significance of the study.\nTHE PURPOSE AND ORGANIZATION OF A LITERATURE\nREVIEW\nBefore searching the literature for a study, consider the intent or purpose of a literature review and plan\nfor its organization. Literature reviews differ for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods projects.\nPurpose of a Literature Review\nThe literature review accomplishes several purposes. It shares with the reader the results of other\nstudies that are closely related to the one being undertaken. It relates a study to the larger, ongoing\ndialogue in the literature, filling in gaps and extending prior studies (Cooper, 2010; Marshall & Rossman,\n2022). It provides a framework for establishing the importance of the study and a benchmark for\ncomparing the results with other findings. All or some of these reasons may be the foundation for writing\nthe scholarly literature into a study (see Boote & Beile, 2005, for a more extensive discussion of\npurposes for compiling a literature review in research). Studies need to add to the body of literature on a\ntopic. Researchers shape literature sections in proposals from the larger problem to the narrower issue.\nThis narrow issue, in turn, leads directly into the methods for studying the issue.\nThe Organization of the Literature Review\nGeneral Forms\nIn addition to the purpose of a literature review, consider how to organize it. In graduate proposals, it can\nassume various forms. In one model, the literature becomes additional information in an introduction to a\nstudy. In another model, the literature forms a separate chapter in the project. Researchers can name\nthis chapter a “Literature Review” and write the chapter in 20 to 60 pages.\nRegardless of the model, our best advice is to seek the opinion of an adviser or faculty mentors as to\nhow they would like to see the literature addressed. We generally recommend to our advisees that the\nliterature review in a proposal or project be brief and provide a summary of the major studies addressing\nthe research problem. It does not need to be fully developed and comprehensive at this point because\nfaculty may ask for major changes in the study at the proposal meeting.\nThe literature review in a journal article is an abbreviated form found in a dissertation or master’s thesis.\nIt is typically contained in a section called “Related Literature” and follows the introduction to a study. This\nis the pattern for quantitative research articles in journals. For qualitative research articles the literature\nreview may be found in a separate section, included in the introduction, or threaded throughout the study.\nIn general, the literature review can take several forms. Cooper (2010) discussed four types: literature\nreviews that (a) integrate what others have done and said, (b) criticize previous scholarly works, (c) build\nbridges between related topics, and (d) identify the central issues in a field. Most dissertation and thesis\nliterature reviews integrate what others have done and said, organize it into a series of related topics\n(often from general topics to narrower ones), and summarize the literature by pointing out the central\nissues. Regardless of the form, another consideration is how the literature might be presented depending\non a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods project.",

        "text": "A Qualitative Structure\nIn qualitative research, inquirers use the literature consistent with the assumptions of learning from the\nparticipant and not prescribe questions needing answers from the researcher’s standpoint. One of the\nchief reasons for conducting a qualitative study is that the study is exploratory. This usually means that\nnot much has been written about the topic or the population studied, and the researcher seeks to listen to\nparticipants and build an understanding based on what they hear.\nHowever, the use of the literature in qualitative research varies considerably. In theoretically oriented\nstudies, such as ethnographies or critical ethnographies, the literature on a cultural concept or a critical\ntheory is introduced early in the report or proposal as an orienting framework. In grounded theory, case\nstudies, and phenomenological studies, literature is less often used to set the stage for the study.\nWith an approach grounded in learning from participants and variation by type, there are several models\nfor incorporating the literature review into a qualitative study. We offer three placement locations for the\nliterature review, and it can be used in any or all locations. As shown in Table 2.1, the researcher might\ninclude the literature review in the introduction. In this placement, the literature provides a useful rationale\nfor the problem or issue. This rationale may present a need for the study based on advancing the\nimportance of studying the issue. This framing of the problem is, of course, contingent on available\nstudies. One can find illustrations of this model in many qualitative studies employing different types of\ninquiry strategy. For a qualitative study the literature review might explore aspects of the central\nphenomenon being addressed and divide it into topical areas.\nTable 2.1 Using Literature in a Qualitative Study\nExamples of\nUse of the Literature Criteria Suitable\nStrategy Types\nThe literature frames the There must be some literature available.

Keep in\nmind the options: placing it at the beginning to frame the problem, placing it in a separate section, and\nusing it at the end to compare with the findings.\nA Quantitative Structure\nA second form is to review the literature in a separate section, a model typically used in quantitative\nresearch, and often found in journals with a quantitative orientation. Quantitative research includes\nsubstantial literature at the beginning of a study to provide direction for the research questions or\nhypotheses. It is also used to introduce a problem or detail the existing literature in a section titled\n“Related Literature” or “Review of Literature” or some other similar phrase. Also, the literature review can\nintroduce a theory—an explanation for expected relationships (see Chapter 3)—describe the theory that\nwill be used, and suggest why it is a useful theory to examine. At the end of a study, the researcher then\nrevisits the literature and compares the results with the existing findings in the literature. In this model, the\nquantitative researcher uses the literature deductively as a framework for the research questions or\nhypotheses.\nA model for the quantitative structure relates to the variables studied (more will be developed on\nvariables in Chapter 3). A model is to write a quantitative literature review of the literature that contains\nsections about the literature related to major independent variables, major dependent variables, and\nstudies that relate the independent and dependent variables. This approach seems appropriate for\ndissertations and conceptualizing the literature to be introduced in a journal article. Consider this model\nliterature review to comprise five components: (a) an introduction, (b) Topic 1 (about the independent\nvariable), (c) Topic 2 (about the dependent variable), (d) Topic 3, (studies that address both the\nindependent and dependent variables), and (e) a summary. Here is more detail about each section:\nIntroduce the review by telling the reader about the sections included in it. This passage provides a\nstatement about the organization of the section.\nReview Topic 1, addressing the scholarly literature about the independent variable or variables. With\nseveral independent variables, consider subsections or focus on the single most important variable\nfor the literature review. Remember to address only the literature about the independent variable;\nkeep the literature about the independent and dependent variables separate in this model.\nReview Topic 2, incorporating the scholarly literature about the dependent variable or variables. With\nmultiple dependent variables, write subsections about each variable or focus on a single important\none.\nReview Topic 3, including the scholarly literature that relates the independent variable(s) to the\ndependent variable(s). Here we are at the crux of the proposed quantitative study. Thus, this section\nshould be relatively short and contain studies that are extremely close in topic to the proposed study.\nPerhaps nothing has been written on the topic. Construct a section as close as possible to the topic\nor review studies that address the topic at a more general level.",

        "text": "Provide a summary that highlights the most important studies, captures major themes, suggests why\nmore research is needed on the topic, and advances how the proposed study will fill this need.\nThis model focuses the literature review, relates it closely to the variables in the research questions and\nhypotheses, and sufficiently narrows the study. It becomes a logical point of departure for the research\nquestions and the method section.\nOverall, in a quantitative project, use the literature in a quantitative study deductively—as a basis for\nadvancing research questions or hypotheses. In a quantitative study plan, use the literature to introduce\nthe study, advance a theory, describe related literature in a separate section, and compare findings.\nA Mixed Methods Structure\nIn a mixed methods study, the researcher uses either a qualitative or a quantitative approach to the\nliterature, depending on the type of strategy used. In a sequential approach, the literature is presented in\neach phase consistent with the method being used. For example, suppose the study begins with a\nquantitative phase. In that case the investigator is likely to include a substantial literature review that\nhelps establish a rationale for the research questions or hypotheses. If the study begins with a qualitative\nphase, then the literature is substantially less, and the researcher may incorporate it more into the end of\nthe study—an inductive approach. If the research advances a mixed methods study with an equal weight\nand emphasis on qualitative and quantitative data, then the literature may take either qualitative or\nquantitative forms. The decision as to which form to use is based on the audience for the study and what\nwould be most receptive to the students’ graduate committees and their orientation.\nTo recap, the literature used in a mixed methods project will depend on the strategy and the relative\nweight given to the qualitative or quantitative research in the study. In a mixed methods study, use the\nliterature that is consistent with the major type of design and the qualitative or quantitative approach most\nprevalent in the design (see Chapter 10 for more about designs).\nSTEPS IN CONDUCTING A LITERATURE REVIEW\nA literature review means locating and summarizing the studies about a topic. Often these are research\nstudies, but they may also include conceptual articles or opinion pieces that provide frameworks for\nthinking about topics. There is no single way to conduct a literature review, but many scholars proceed\nsystematically to capture, evaluate, and summarize the literature. The steps mentioned next provide an\noverview of the process of searching for the literature. Researchers may not follow the steps precisely\nas presented here. Often the process of research requires an iterative process of searching and then re-\nsearching the literature until finding appropriate material. Here is the way we recommend:\n1. Begin by identifying key words, which are useful in locating materials in an academic library at a\ncollege or university. These key words may emerge in identifying a topic or result from preliminary\nreadings. For example, a researcher may start with the broad term, “mental health” and, after\nsearching the literature, narrow the term to “autism spectrum disorder,” and then further specify\nmultiple terms, such as “family factors, support, autism spectrum disorder” that serve to narrow the\nfocus of the search.\n2. With the key words in mind, use your home computer to search the databases for holdings (i.e.,\njournals and books). Most major libraries have computerized databases. Search general databases,\nincluding ERIC, Google Scholar, Web of Science, EBSCO, ProQuest, and JSTOR. These cover a\nbroad range of disciplines.\n3. Initially, try to locate about 50 reports of research in articles or books related to your topic. Set a\npriority on the search for journal articles and books because they are easy to locate and obtain.\nDetermine whether these articles and books exist in an academic library or whether they need to be\nobtained from an interlibrary loan or purchased through a bookstore.\n4. Skim this initial group of articles or chapters, and collect those central to your topic. Throughout this\nprocess, simply try to obtain a sense about whether the article or chapter will make a useful\ncontribution to your understanding of the literature (see the evaluation criteria to follow).\n5. As you identify useful literature, begin designing a literature map (to be discussed more fully later).\nThis is a visual picture (or figure) of groupings of the literature on the topic that illustrates how your\nparticular study will add to the existing literature and position your study within the larger body of\nresearch.",

        "text": "6. As you put together the literature map, also begin to draft summaries of the most relevant articles.\nCombine these summaries into the final literature review that you write for your proposal or research\nstudy. Include precise references to the literature using an appropriate style guide, such as the\nPublication Manual (American Psychological Association, 2020) for complete references to use at\nthe end of the proposal or study.\n7. After summarizing the literature, assemble the literature review, structuring it thematically or\norganizing it by important concepts. End the literature review with a summary of the major themes,\nand suggest how the study further adds to the literature and addresses a gap in the themes. This\nsummary should also point toward the methods (i.e., data collection and data analysis) to be written\nafter the literature review. In this summary, a researcher could also advance a critique of the past\nliterature and point out deficiencies in it and issues in its methods (see Boote & Beile, 2005).\nSEARCHING THE LITERATURE\nThe literature search requires knowing databases to search, prioritizing the types of literature available,\nassessing the quality of the literature before including it in a review, developing written notes or abstracts\nfor each source, and organizing the literature through a visual map.\nComputer Databases\nTo facilitate collecting relevant material, use computerized databases for accessing the literature.\nComputer databases of the literature are available through the internet, and they provide easy access\nto thousands of journals, conference papers, and materials on many different topics. Academic libraries\nat major universities house commercial and public domain databases. We will review only a few of the\nmajor databases available, but they represent major sources of information for literature reviews.\nERIC is a free online digital library of education research and information sponsored by the Institute\nof Education Sciences (IES) of the U.S. Department of Education. ERIC provides a search of 1.4\nmillion items indexed since 1966. It is found on the internet at http://eric.ed.gov. The collection\nincludes journal articles, books, research syntheses, conference papers, technical reports, policy\npapers, and other education-related materials. To best use ERIC, identify appropriate descriptors for\nyour topic, as in the terms used by indexers to categorize articles or documents. Researchers can\nsearch through the Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors (Educational Resources Information Center,\n1975) or browse the online thesaurus.\nAnother free database to search is Google Scholar. It is located on the internet at\nscholar.google.com. It provides a way to broadly search for literature across many disciplines and\nsources, such as peer-reviewed papers, theses, books, abstracts, and articles from academic\npublishers, professional societies, universities, and other scholarly organizations. The articles\nidentified in a Google Scholar search provide links to abstracts, related articles, electronic versions\nof articles affiliated with a library specified, web searches for information about this work, and\nopportunities to purchase the full text of the article.\nResearchers can obtain abstracts to publications in the health sciences through the free-access\nPubMed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). It is available at pubmed.gov on the internet. This database is a\nservice of the U.S. National Library of Medicine, and it includes over 17 million citations from\nMEDLINE and life science journals for biomedical articles going back to the 1950s. PubMed includes\nlinks to full-text articles (located in academic libraries) and other related resources. A PubMed User\nGuide is available at pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. This guide provides useful information about steps in\nsearching by citation, author, journal, and date of publication.\nAlso available is ProQuest (proquest.com), which enables a researcher to search many different\ndatabases, and it is one of the largest online content repositories in the world. It advertises that it\nholds the world’s largest collection of dissertations and theses.\nAnother database is EBSCO (ebsco.com). It is a mega-database featuring many specialized\ndatabases. Because EBSCO taps into many different databases, it can be one search tool to use\nbefore using more specialized databases. It is also an online research service, including full-text\ndatabases, subject indexes, point-of-care medical references, historical digital archives, and e-\nbooks. The company provides access to more than 350 databases and nearly 300,000 e-books.",

        "text": "Scopus is an institutional-subscription database for literature. It advertises as the largest abstract\nand citation database of peer-reviewed literature, scientific journals, books and conference\nproceedings. It is available from Elsevier Publications.\nConsider the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). This database is a specialized academic\ndatabase in that all the articles indexed are open access and can be accessed free of charge. Open\naccess means that the copyright holder of a scholarly work grants usage rights to others using an\nopen license. This database contains more than 7 million articles and 17,500 journals. It was a\nservice launched in 2003, and it covers all areas of science, technology, medicine, social sciences,\narts and humanities.\nOther more specialized commercially licensed databases found in many academic libraries include\nSociological Abstracts (Cambridge Scientific Abstracts), available under ProQuest in academic\nlibraries, and PsycINFO (www.apa.org).\nIn summary, our research tips for searching computer databases are to do the following:\nUse both the free, online literature databases and those available through your institutional academic\nlibrary.\nSearch several databases, even if you feel that your topic is not strictly education, as found in ERIC,\nor psychology, as found in PsycINFO. Both ERIC and PsycINFO view education and psychology as\nbroad terms for many topics.\nUse guides to terms to locate your articles, such as a thesaurus, when available.\nA process for conducting a search is to locate recent journal articles and documents on a topic.\nConduct a preliminary search using descriptors from the online thesaurus and locating a journal\narticle or document on a topic. Then look closely at the descriptors used in this article and document,\nand run another search using these terms. This procedure will maximize the possibility of obtaining a\ngood list of articles for your literature review.\nUse databases that provide access to full-text copies of your articles (through academic libraries, the\ninternet connection to a library, or for a fee) as much as possible to reduce the amount of time\nsearching for copies of your articles. Consider searching the free DOAJ.\nTypes of Literature\nWith so much literature available, we recommend a priority for reviewing the different types of literature\nto maximize the time spent in search. Also, there is a need to evaluate the quality of the information\ngathered and to apply a set of criteria for assessing whether the information should be included in the\nreview.\nPriority of the Literature\nWe use a priority for a search of the literature to save time. What types of literature might be reviewed,\nand in what priority? If you are examining a topic for the first time and unaware of the research, start with\nbroad syntheses of the literature, such as overviews found in encyclopedias (e.g., Aikin, 1992; Keeves,\n1988). You might also look for summaries of the literature on your topic presented in journal articles or\nabstract series (e.g., Annual Review of Psychology, 1950–).\nNext, turn to journal articles in respected scientific journals—especially those that report research\nstudies. By research, we mean that the author or authors pose a question or hypothesis, collect data,\nand answer the question or hypothesis with the data. There are journals widely read in your field, and\ntypically they are publications with a high-quality editorial board comprising leading scientists. Start with\nthe most recent issues of the journals, look for studies about a topic, and then work backward in time.\nFollow up on references at the end of the articles for more sources to examine.",

        "text": "Turn to books related to the topic. Begin with research monographs that summarize the scholarly\nliterature. Then consider entire books on a single topic by an author or group of authors or books that\ncontain chapters written by different authors. Follow this search by looking for recent conference papers.\nLook for major national conferences and the papers delivered at them. Often conference papers report\nthe latest research developments. Most major conferences either require or request that authors submit\ntheir papers for inclusion in computerized indices. Contact authors of pertinent studies. Seek them out at\nconferences. Write or phone them, asking if they know studies related to an area of interest, and inquire\nif they have an instrument that might be used or modified for use in a study.\nThe web also provides helpful materials for a literature review. The easy access and ability to capture\nentire articles enhances the attractiveness of the material. However, evaluate these articles carefully for\nquality, and be cautious about whether they represent rigorous, thoughtful, and systematic research\nsuitable for use in a literature review.\nOverall Evaluation Quality\nBefore including the literature in a research proposal or study, evaluate the quality of the material. Only\nhigh-quality literature should be included. How would a researcher judge the quality? For journals, find\narticles from nationally refereed publications. These are journals with an editorial review board. Journal\nissues list editorial board members typically in the first few pages of an issue. Online journals, in addition,\noften include articles that have undergone rigorous reviews by editorial boards. Check whether the journal\nhas a refereed editorial board that reviews manuscripts and has published standards for accepting\nmanuscripts in an editorial statement.\nFor books, look at publishers with name recognition and length of service over many years. An online\nsearch can provide information about the publishing house. We generally recommend books (and journal\narticles) published in the last 10 years. Conference papers can provide useful, high-quality information if\nthe paper is included as a paper in a recent conference. If reporting in literature review web studies, look\nfor literature that has been reviewed for quality. Contacting the web source can provide this useful\ninformation. Further, advisers or mentors can recommend high-quality literature to include in a proposal or\nstudy.\nAbstracting the Literature\nWhen reviewing the literature, it is helpful to develop abstracts of the studies to later include in the review.\nAn abstract is a brief review of the literature (typically a short paragraph) that summarizes major\nelements to enable a reader to understand the basic features of the article or book. Researchers need to\nconsider what material to extract and summarize when developing an abstract. This is important\ninformation when reviewing perhaps dozens, if not hundreds, of studies.\nComponents of an Abstract\nA model for developing an abstract exists in the abstracts for journal articles. A good summary of a\nresearch study reported in a journal for a data-based article might include the following points in an\nabstract:\nMention the problem being addressed.\nState the central purpose or focus of the study.\nBriefly state information about the sample, population, or subjects.\nReview key results that relate to the proposed study.\nIf it is a critique or methods review (Cooper, 2010), point out technical and methodological flaws in\nthe study.",

In well-\ncrafted journal articles, the problem and purpose statements are clearly stated in the introduction.\nInformation about the sample, population, or subjects is found midway through in a method (or\nprocedure) section. In the results sections, look for passages in which the researchers report information\nto answer or address each research question or hypothesis. For book-length research studies, look for\nthe same points.\nTheoretical, Conceptual, and Methodological Abstracts\nHow are studies advancing the methods of research, theories, typologies, or syntheses of past research\nabstracted because these are not research studies? The material to be extracted from these non-\nempirical studies would be as follows (see Example 2.1):\nMention the problem addressed by the article or book.\nIdentify the central theme of the study.\nState the major conclusions related to this theme.\nIf the review type is methodological, mention flaws in reasoning, logic, force of argument, and so\nforth.\nExample 2.1 Components of a Methodological Journal Article Abstract\nThe following abstract for an article advancing quality criteria for mixed methods research (Hirose\n& Creswell, 2022) illustrates the major components of a methodological article:\nRecent published articles and comments by researchers, federal recommendations, and\nprofessional association standards have recommended core quality criteria for designing\nand writing mixed methods research. Unfortunately, a synthesis of recent timely\nrecommendations has not been made, and we can draw guidance from them for detailed\nguidance for beginning researchers (the research problem). This article presents six\nbest practices in mixed methods culled from recent sources, discusses the need for each\npractice, and then illustrates its use in a recent empirical study from Japan (the purpose\nof the study and the topics addressed). This article contributes to the field of mixed\nmethods methodology by providing a parsimonious list of core criteria based on\nsynthesizing three recent influential recommendations to illustrate a state-of-the-art set of\ncore quality criteria.\nThis abstract is short because it was limited to only 120 words as stated in the author’s guidelines for the\njournal. Still, it represents a concise abstract for a methodological article that conveys the purpose, and\nthe major topics in the study. Also, the final sentence mentions the contribution of the article to the field of\nmixed methods. Stating the contribution reflects the criteria required by the journal.\nA Literature Map\nOne of the first tasks for a researcher working with a new topic is to organize the literature. As\nmentioned earlier, this organization enables a person to understand how the proposed study adds to,\nextends, or replicates research completed.\nA useful approach for this step is to design a literature map (see Figure 2.1). This is an idea that we\ndeveloped several years ago, and it has been a useful tool for students to use when organizing their\nreview of the literature for making presentations to graduate committees, summarizing the literature for a\nscholarly presentation, or composing an article for journal publication.",

Janovec’s map\nillustrates a hierarchical design, and she used several principles of good map design:\nShe placed her topic in the box at the top of the hierarchy.\nNext, she took the studies that she found in computer searches, located copies of these studies, and\norganized them into three broad subtopics (i.e., Justice Perceptions Formation, Justice Effects, and\nJustice in Organizational Change). For another map, the researcher may have more or fewer than\nthree major categories, depending on the extent and publications on the topic.\nWithin each box are labels that describe the nature of the studies in the box (i.e., outcomes).\nAlso within each box are references to major citations illustrating its content. It is useful to use\ncurrent and illustrative references of the topic of the box and to briefly state the references in an\nappropriate style, such as APA (American Psychological Association, 2020).\nShe included several levels for her literature map. In other words, major topics lead to subtopics and\nthen to sub-subtopics.\nSome branches of the chart are more developed than others. The extent of development depends on\nthe amount of literature available and the depth of the exploration of the literature by the researcher.",

        "text": "After organizing the literature into a diagram, Janovec (2001) next considered the branches of the\nfigure that provided a springboard for her proposed study. She placed a “Need to Study” (or\nproposed study) box at the bottom of the map, she briefly identified the nature of this proposed\nstudy (Procedural Justice and Culture), and she then drew lines to past literature that her project\nwould extend. She proposed this study based on ideas written by other authors in the future\nresearch sections of their studies.\nIn this way, a reader could see how her study added to the existing literature by building on the three\nbroad categories of literature.\nAlthough not evident in her map, she included quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies in\nher literature map.\nFinally, she could have written a narrative description of the literature map for her committee or\npresentation. In it, she could discuss the heading box at the top of the map and the databases\nreviewed. She could have specified the divisions of the literature into broad topics and indicated the\nspecific topic that she planned to study (at the bottom box of the map). Finally she could discuss\nhow her topic expanded branches in the literature (the connecting lines).\nComposing a literature map is challenging. You need to do the following:\nEducate readers. Individuals seeing this map for the first time may not be familiar with this approach\nto organizing the literature. Carefully explain the intent of the map and the position of your study\nwithin it.\nTake the time necessary. It takes time to develop such a map and locate literature to put into the\nmap. For a preliminary map, we consider collecting maybe 25 studies. For a full literature map for a\ndissertation or thesis, this number may expand to 100 studies or more.\nLimit the branches leading to your study. Figuring out how your study adds to the literature takes\nsome time. Select one or two subdivisions that your study will extend, and then draw the lines from\nyour proposed topic to the subdivisions.\nConsider the broad topic. Consider carefully the broad topic at the top of the map. This is the topic\nto which your literature map adds. Ask others who know the literature to see how they would group\nthe studies stemming from the broad topic.\nRevise the map. Go through several versions of the map. Develop a preliminary map, write the\ndiscussion, and solicit feedback from others.\nDraw with a software program. Use a software program to draw the figure, such as a Word\ndocument or a PowerPoint slide.\nSTYLE MANUAL USE\nStyle manuals provide guidelines for creating a scholarly form of uniform and consistent communication\nso that readers focus on ideas rather than formatting and can scan articles. A consistent style exists for\nciting references, creating headings, presenting tables and figures, and using bias-free language.\nResearchers need to select one style manual to use following the type of style recommended by their\ndiscipline, field, and institution.\nSeveral style manuals exist. The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association\n(American Psychological Association, 2020) is the most popular style manual in the social sciences. This\nmanual should be purchased early in the training of students and researchers. The Chicago Manual of\nStyle, 17th Edition (University of Chicago Press, 2017) is also used in many disciplines in the social\nsciences. Some journals have developed their variations of the popular styles.\nWe will focus on using the Publication Manual (American Psychological Association, 2020). Our first\nrecommendation is to examine all the chapters of this new edition style manual. It provides a useful guide\nfor writing and publishing papers, ethics (and plagiarism and unethical writing), formatting a paper, and",

It also covers mechanics of\nstyle, such as punctuation, capitalization, abbreviations, numbers, and statistics. It includes helpful\ninformation about the publication process.\nOur focus will be on specific elements that researchers will need to understand to complete a graduate\nproposal or a research project. We provide guidance about several new features available in the latest\nseventh edition of the Publication Manual:\nWhen writing in-text citations, keep in mind the appropriate form for types of references, and pay\nclose attention to the format for multiple citations. In citing works with three or more authors, state\nonly the first author name, and “et al.” is needed rather than multiple authors.\nWhen writing the end-of-text references, note the appropriate way to cite journal articles, books,\nconferences papers, and internet and social media documents. In the new Publication Manual\nreaders can view more than 100 examples of the correct reference for documents. One major\nchange in the new APA Publication Manual is that the location of publishers is no longer needed.\nInstead of citing, “Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE,” authors can abbreviate this to be “SAGE.”\nThe headings are ordered in a scholarly paper in terms of five levels. Typically, authors use three or\nfour levels of headings in proposals and projects, A level 1 heading would be the title of the proposal\nor project. Level 2 establishes the major content sections of the work, and levels 3–5 subdivide the\nmajor content into sections. The new edition of the Publication Manual has changed the format for\nlevels 3 through 5 to provide greater clarity through bold letters and indentations. A useful table\npresenting the heading levels is available in the Publication Manual.\nThe new edition of the Publication Manual emphasizes the importance of inclusive and bias-free\nlanguage. Also see their guidelines as found in https://www.apa.org/about/apa/equity-diversity-\ninclusive/language-guidelines.pdf. Researchers should use singular “they” instead of “him” or “her.”\nBias-free language applies to statements about age, disability, gender, racial and ethnic identity, and\nsexual orientation. We will say more about this guidance in Chapter 4 and ethical issues in reporting\nstudies.\nFootnotes provide additional content or attribution to copyright holders. They may provide\nsupplemental information to the text and should be included only if they strengthen the text. They are\nnot frequently used in proposal or academic reports. See the Publication Manual for appropriate\nformatting for footnotes.\nThe Publication Manual provides examples for formatting tables and figures. Careful attention needs\nto be given to the headings because the recent APA edition recommends italicizing the title of tables\nand figures.\nIn summary, the most important aspect of using a style manual is to provide a consistent reporting style\nfor readers.\nTHE DEFINITION OF TERMS\nAnother topic related to reviewing the literature is the identification and definition of terms that readers\nwill need to understand a proposed research project. A definition of terms section may be found separate\nfrom the literature review, included as part of the literature review, or placed in different sections of a\nproposal.\nDefine terms individuals outside the field of study may not understand and that go beyond common\nlanguage (Locke et al., 2014). Whether a term should be defined is a matter of judgment, but define a\nterm if there is any likelihood that readers will not know its meaning. Also, define terms when they first\nappear so that a reader does not read ahead in the proposal operating with one set of definitions only to\nfind out later that the author uses a different set. As Wilkinson (1991) commented, “Scientists have\nsharply defined terms with which to think clearly about their research and to communicate their findings\nand ideas accurately” (p. 22). Defining terms also adds precision to a scientific study, as Firestone\n(1987) stated:",

        "text": "The words of an everyday language are rich in multiple meanings. Like other symbols, their\npower comes from the combination of meaning in a specific setting. . . . Scientific language\nostensibly strips this multiplicity of meaning from words in the interest of precision. This is the\nreason common terms are given “technical meanings” for scientific purposes. (p. 17)\nWith this need for precision, one finds terms stated early in the introduction to articles. In dissertations\nand thesis proposals, researchers define terms typically in a special section of the study. The rationale is\nthat in formal research, students must be precise in how they use language and terms. The need to\nground thoughts in authoritative definitions constitutes good scientific practice.\nGeneral Guidelines\nNo one approach governs how one defines the terms in a study, but several suggestions follow (see also\nLocke et al., 2014):\nDefine a term when it first appears in the proposal. For example, in the introduction, a term may\nrequire a definition to help the reader understand the research problem and questions or hypotheses\nin the study.\nWrite definitions at a specific operational or applied level. Operational definitions are written in\nspecific language rather than abstract, conceptual language. We prefer operational definitions\nbecause the definition section in a dissertation provides an opportunity for the author to be specific\nabout terms.\nDo not define the terms in everyday language; instead, use accepted language available in the\nresearch literature. In this way, the terms are grounded in the literature and not invented (Locke et\nal., 2014). It is possible that the precise definition of a term is not available in the literature and\neveryday language will need to be used. In this case, provide a definition and use the term\nconsistently throughout the plan and the study (Wilkinson, 1991).\nResearchers might define terms so that they accomplish different goals. A definition may describe a\ncommon language word (e.g., organization). It may also be paired with a limitation (e.g., the\ncurriculum may be limited). It may establish a criterion (e.g., high grade point average), and it could\nalso define a term operationally (e.g., reinforcement will be referred to as giving rewards).\nAlthough no one format exists for defining terms, one approach is to develop a separate section,\ncalled the “Definition of Terms,” and clearly set off the terms and their definitions by highlighting the\nterms. In this way, the word is assigned an invariant meaning (Locke et al., 2014). Typically, this\nseparate section is not more than two to three pages.\nSpecial Terms\nSpecial terms that need to be defined appear in all three types of studies: (a) qualitative, (b) quantitative,\nand (c) mixed methods. In qualitative studies, because of the inductive, evolving methodological design,\ninquirers may define few terms at the beginning; although they may advance tentative definitions. Instead,\nthemes (or perspectives or dimensions) may emerge through the data analysis. In the procedure section,\nauthors define these terms as they surface during the process of research. This approach delays the\ndefinition of terms until they appear in the study, and it makes such definitions difficult to specify in\nadvance in research proposals. For this reason, qualitative proposals often do not include separate\nsections for a definition of terms. Instead, writers pose tentative, qualitative definitions threaded\nthroughout the study.\nIn quantitative studies operating more within the deductive model of fixed and set research objectives,\ninclude extensive definitions early in the research proposal. Investigators may place them in separate\nsections and precisely define them. The researchers try to comprehensively define all relevant terms at\nthe beginning of studies and to use accepted definitions found in the literature.\nIn mixed methods studies, it is helpful to readers to define key terms used in this approach to research,\nsuch as “mixed methods,” “convergent design,” “integration,” and “metainferences” (see Chapter 10).

        "text": "approach to definitions might include a separate section if the study begins with a first phase of\nquantitative data collection. If it begins with qualitative data collection, then the terms may emerge during\nthe research, and they are defined in the findings or results section of the final report. However, in all\nmixed methods studies, there are terms that may be unfamiliar to readers—for example, the definition of\na mixed methods study in a procedural discussion (see Chapter 10). Also, clarify terms related to the\nstrategy of inquiry used, such as concurrent or sequential, and the specific name for a strategy (e.g.,\nconvergent design, as discussed in Chapter 10).\nExample 2.2 Defining Terms in a Dissertation\nThis example illustrates a definition of terms presented in a mixed methods study in a separate\nsection of the first chapter that introduces the study. VanHorn-Grassmeyer (1998) studied how\n119 new professionals in student affairs in colleges and universities engage in reflection—either\nindividually or collaboratively. She both surveyed the new professionals and conducted in-depth\ninterviews with them. Because she studied individual and collaborative reflection among student\naffairs professionals, she provided detailed definitions of these terms in the beginning of the study.\nWe illustrate two of her terms next. Notice how she referenced her definitions in meanings formed\nby other authors in the literature:\nIndividual Reflection. Schon (1983) devoted an entire book to concepts he named\nreflective thinking, reflection-in-action, and reflective practice; this after an entire book\nwas written a decade earlier with Argyris (Argyris & Schon, 1978) to introduce the\nconcepts. Therefore, a concise definition of this researcher’s understanding of individual\nreflection that did justice to something that most aptly had been identified as an intuitive\nact was difficult to reach. However, the most salient characteristics of individual reflection\nfor the purposes of this study were these three: (a) an “artistry of practice” (Schon,\n1983), (b) how one practices overtly what one knows intuitively, and (c) how a\nprofessional enhances practice through thoughtful discourse within the mind.\nStudent Affairs Professional. A professional has been described in many ways. One\ndescription identified an individual who exhibited “a high degree of independent judgment,\nbased on a collective, learned body of ideas, perspectives, information, norms, and\nhabits [and who engage(d) in professional knowing]” (Baskett & Marsick, 1992, p. 3). A\nstudent affairs professional has exhibited such traits in service to students in a higher\neducation environment, in any one of a number of functions which support academic and\nco-curricular success (pp. 11–12).\nSummary\nBefore searching the literature, identify your topic, using strategies such as drafting a brief title or\nstating a central research question. Also consider whether this topic can and should be\nresearched by reviewing access to participants and resources. Also, assess the topic for its\ncontribution to the literature, interest to others, and consistency with personal goals.\nResearchers conduct a scholarly literature review to present results of similar studies, to relate\nthe present study to an ongoing dialogue in the literature, and to provide a framework for\ncomparing results of a study with other studies. For qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods\ndesigns, the literature serves different purposes. In qualitative research, the literature helps\nsubstantiate the research problem, but it does not constrain participants’ views. A popular\napproach is to include more literature at the end of a qualitative study than at the beginning. In\nquantitative research, the literature not only helps substantiate the problem but also suggests\npossible questions or hypotheses to be addressed. A separate literature review section is\ntypically found in quantitative studies. In mixed methods research, the use of literature will depend\non the type of design and the intent of the qualitative and quantitative aspects. Regardless of the\ntype of study, consider the type of literature review to conduct, such as an integrative, critical,\nbridging topics, and the identification of central issues.",

Finally, the chapter turns to the use of discipline-based theories\nand social justice theories in mixed methods research.\nTHE VARIED USE OF THEORY\nThe nature of a theory varies considerably in research. Its use varies\ndepending on a quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods study. Theory\ncan be a prediction of what the researcher expects to find or an\ninductive or deductive framework for a study. It may be presented as a\nmodel or diagram of the relationship among variables or constructs. It\nmay exist as generalizations from findings, or a call for action, such as a\nchange-oriented social agenda for a population or society. In these\nstudies, theory goes by diverse names, such as theoretical orientation,\ntheoretical rationale, theoretical model, or simply a theory. It may be\ncalled a “hook” (Sandelowski, 1996) for informing many phases of the\nresearch process.\nBy searching the literature (see Chapter 2), researchers can find\nexamples of theories to use. A close inspection of these theories\nsuggests they often have multiple authors, a date of origin, application in\ndifferent types of studies, a visual model, and a distinct name.\nThe general procedures for locating and including theory are these:\n1. Identify the theory (or theories) from the literature search.\n2. Place the theory (model or conceptual framework) at the beginning\nof the article as an a priori framework to guide the questions or\nhypotheses in the study.\n3. Write about the theory by first advancing the name of the theory to\nbe used followed by a description how it informs the quantitative,\nqualitative, or mixed methods study.\n4. Discuss the studies using the theory, especially studies closely\nrelated to the present study.\n5. Include a diagram of the theory indicating the probable links in the\ntheory and the major concepts or variables in the theory.\n6. Have the theory provide a framework for the study.\n7. Return to the theory at the end of the study to review its role in\ninforming findings and results. Compare the theory use with other\nstudies.\nQUANTITATIVE THEORY USE",

        "text": "Understanding the use of theory in quantitative research requires defining\ntheory, assessing the types of variables and their measurement,\nintroducing the concept of causality, viewing forms of stating theories,\nplacing a theory in a proposal or study, and writing a theory passage.\nDefinition of a Theory in Quantitative Research\nWe start with introducing the specific definition of a theory in quantitative\nresearch. Some historical precedent exists for viewing a theory as a\nscientific prediction or explanation for what the researcher expects to\nfind (see Thomas, 1997, for different ways of conceptualizing theories).\nFor example, Kerlinger’s (1979) definition of a theory seems still valid\ntoday. He said that a theory in quantitative research is “a set of\ninterrelated constructs (variables), definitions, and propositions that\npresents a systematic view of phenomena by specifying relations among\nvariables, with the purpose of explaining natural phenomena” (p. 64).\nIn this definition, a theory has a purpose (i.e., explains) and a procedure\n(i.e., the relationship among interrelated variables). These interrelations\nexist in the form of propositions or hypotheses. We would add to this\ndefinition that another purpose of a theory is to predict the expected\nrelationship among variables. Labovitz and Hagedorn (1971) used the\nterm theoretical rationale to describe a theory. They defined this\nrationale as “specifying how and why the variables and relational\nstatements are interrelated” (p. 17). Why would an independent variable,\nX, influence or affect a dependent variable, Y? The theory provides an\nexplanation for this expectation or prediction. A discussion about this\ntheory would appear in a section of a proposal in the literature review or\nin a separate section called the theory base, the theoretical rationale,\nthe theoretical perspective, or the conceptual framework. We prefer the\nterm theoretical perspective because it has been popularly used as a\nrequired section for proposals for research when one applies to present\na paper at the American Educational Research Association conference.\nA theory might appear in a research study as an argument, a discussion,\na figure, a rationale, or a visual model. The metaphor of a rainbow can\nhelp visualize how a theory operates. Assume that the rainbow bridges\nthe independent and dependent variables (or constructs). This rainbow\nties together the variables and provides an overarching explanation for\nhow and why one would expect the independent variables to explain or\npredict the dependent variables.\nTheories develop when researchers test a prediction over and over. For\nexample, here is how the process of developing a theory works.",

These questions\nprovide information about the type of relationship (positive, negative, or\nunknown) and its magnitude (e.g., high or low).\nForming this information into a predictive statement (hypothesis), a\nresearcher might write, “The greater the centralization of power in\nleaders, the greater the disenfranchisement of the followers.” When\nresearchers test hypotheses such as this over and over in different\nsettings and with different populations (e.g., the Boy Scouts, a\nPresbyterian church, the Rotary Club, and a group of high school\nstudents), a theory emerges, and someone gives it a name (e.g., a\ntheory of attribution). Thus, theory develops as an explanation to\nadvance knowledge in fields (Thomas, 1997).\nAnother aspect of theories is that they vary in their breadth of coverage.\nNeuman (2009) reviewed theories at three levels: (a) micro level, (b)\nmeso level, and (c) macro level. Micro-level theories provide\nexplanations limited to small slices of time, space, or numbers of people,\nsuch as a theory of face work, which explains how people engage in\nrituals during face-to-face interactions. Meso-level theories link the micro\nand macro levels. These are theories of organizations, social movement,\nor communities, such as a theory of control in organizations. Macro-level\ntheories explain larger aggregates, such as social institutions, cultural\nsystems, and whole societies. A macro-level theory of social\nstratification, for example, explains how the amount of surplus a society\nproduces increases with the development of the society.\nVariables in Quantitative Research\nTheories explain relationships among variables. A variable refers to a\ncharacteristic or attribute of an individual or an organization that\nresearchers can measure or observe and varies among the individuals or\norganizations. Examples of variables are gender; age; socioeconomic\nstatus (SES); and attitudes or behaviors such as racism, social control,\npolitical power, or leadership.\nHere are the types of variables in quantitative research:\nIndependent variables influence, or affect, outcomes in studies.\nThey are “independent” because researchers manipulate them in\nexperiments and are thus independent of all other influences.

Other participants in a comparison group were instructed to\nmaintain their normal consumption patterns (control group). In this\ncase, the researcher systematically manipulated red wine\nconsumption. Moderate red wine consumption is an independent\nvariable in this study. Independent variables are also commonly\nreferred to as treatment or manipulated variables in experimental\nstudies.\nDependent variables are variables that depend on the independent\nvariables. They are the outcomes or results influenced by the\nindependent variables. We find multiple dependent measures in\nexperimental studies, such as in the red wine example, measuring\ndependent variables, such as heart attack incidence, strokes, or the\namount of plaque formations.\nPredictor variables (also called antecedent variables) are variables\nthat predict an outcome of interest in survey method studies.\nPredictor variables are like independent variables in that they are\nhypothesized to affect outcomes in a study. However, they are\ndissimilar because the researcher cannot systematically manipulate\na predictor variable. It may not be possible or feasible to assign\nindividuals to a red wine consumption or control group (as an\nindependent variable), but it may be possible to measure naturally\noccurring red wine consumption in a community sample as a\npredictor variable.\nOutcome variables (also called criterion or response variables)\nare considered outcomes or results of predictor variables in survey\nmethod studies. They share the same properties as dependent\nvariables as described above.\nIntervening or mediating variables stand between the\nindependent and dependent variables, and they transmit the effect\nof an independent variable on a dependent variable (for a review,\nsee MacKinnon et al., 2007). A mediating variable can be tested\nusing different kinds of statistical mediation analyses (see\nMacKinnon et al., 2007, for some examples). It provides a\nquantitative assessment of how the independent variable is exerting\nits effects on the dependent variable.

These variables act on (or\ninteract with) the independent variables and, in combination with\nthem, influence the dependent variables. Moderating variables are\npowerful in that they can identify potential boundary conditions.\nOften these moderating variables are demographic information,\nsuch as age, education, or SES.\nA confounding variable refers to a “third variable” that is both\nrelated to the independent (or predictor) variable and to the\ndependent (or outcome) variable. For example, a researcher may\ndraw the conclusion that moderate red wine consumption reduces\nheart attack risk. But it might be possible that regular aerobic\nexercise is a confounding variable because regular exercise is both\nrelated to moderate wine consumption and to heart disease risk.\nConfounding variables can be especially problematic if they go\nunmeasured in a study.\nIn a quantitative research study, researchers describe the relationships\namong variables to build theories and to answer specific research\nquestions. Specifically, we use our theories and specification of variables\nto generate hypotheses. A hypothesis is a prediction about a specific\nevent or relationship between variables. Researchers gather responses\nfrom participants to questions about these variables. In other words, the\nresearcher measures responses from participants to variables. Several\ntexts provide detailed discussions about the scales of measurement for\nvariables (e.g., Isaac & Michael, 1981; Keppel, 1991; Kerlinger, 1979;\nThompson, 2006; Thorndike, 1997). A scale of measurement in\nquantitative research would be the response options available to\nparticipants on instruments or collected by the researcher observing\nparticipants. Variables are measured as either categorical or continuous\n(Creswell & Guetterman, 2018). Categorical scales have two types,\nnominal and ordinal. Continuous scales also have two types: interval\nand ratio. Nominal scales use categories that a participant would check,\nsuch as level of education. A researcher might ask: How much education\ndo you have? The researcher provides the response options of none,\nbachelor’s, or graduate education. An ordinal scale represents\ncategories for the participant to check but provides the categories in a\nrank order. For example, a researcher would ask the question: Has your",

The scale of strongly agree to strongly\ndisagree represents a common example of a type of continuous scale. A\nresearcher would ask participants to respond to a question, such as, Do\nyou agree the economy is in a recession? Answers would be on a 1–5\nscale from strongly agree, agree, and undecided to disagree and\nstrongly disagree.\nTesting Causal Claims in Quantitative Research\nWith an understanding of variables, we will now discuss how the\nvariables might be related to each other, especially in a time sequence.\nThis introduces the concept of causality. A leading writer in this area has\nbeen Blalock (1991). Causality means that we would expect variable X\nto cause variable Y. An example illustrates the application of causality.\nDoes drinking one glass of red wine daily cause a reduced risk for a\nheart attack? In this case, daily wine consumption is the X variable, and\na heart attack event would be the Y variable. One critically important\nconsideration in evaluating causal claims (like this red wine consumption\nexample) is whether an unmeasured third variable Z may cause the\noutcome (see the definition of a confounding variable). For example, a\nconfounding Z variable (such as daily exercise) may be positively\nassociated with both moderate red wine consumption and a reduced\npossibility of a heart attack. In quantitative research this third variable\ncan be a problem for establishing causality if unmeasured. We would not\nwant to mistakenly infer that moderate red wine consumption promotes\na healthy heart if it plays no causal role in reducing heart attacks. If you\naim to test a causal claim about the relationship between two or more\nvariables in your quantitative study, the best choice is to conduct a true\nexperiment, which will provide more control over potential unmeasured\nvariables (see Chapter 8). If you are less interested in testing a causal\nclaim or if you cannot conduct an experiment, then survey methods can\ntest claims about hypothesized associations between variables (see\nChapter 8). For example, you may be interested in first establishing if a\npositive association exists between moderate daily red wine\nconsumption and clinical markers of heart disease risk using correlation\nanalysis. Indeed, epidemiological health science studies highlight a\npositive association between moderate daily red wine consumption (1–2\ndrinks per day) and a 20% reduction in risk for heart disease (e.g.,\nSzmitko & Verma, 2005).",

Because of this time ordering, one variable affects or predicts\nanother variable. Temporal order also means that quantitative\nresearchers think about variables in an order from left to right (Punch,\n2014) and order the variables in purpose statements, research\nquestions, and visual models in this way.\nStating Theories in Quantitative Research\nHow does the causal linking of variables appear in a research study?\nResearchers state their theories in research proposals in several ways,\nsuch as a series of hypotheses, if-then logic statements, or visual\nmodels. First, some researchers state theories in the form of\ninterconnected hypotheses. For example, Hopkins (1964) conveyed his\ntheory of influence processes as a series of 15 hypotheses. Some of the\nhypotheses are as follows (we have slightly altered several hypotheses\nto remove gender-specific pronouns):\nThe higher one’s rank, the greater one’s centrality.\nThe greater one’s centrality, the greater one’s observability.\nThe higher one’s rank, the greater one’s observability.\nThe greater one’s centrality, the greater one’s conformity.\nThe higher one’s rank, the greater one’s conformity.\nThe greater one’s observability, the greater one’s conformity.\nThe greater one’s conformity, the greater one’s observability. (p. 51)\nA second way is to state a theory as a series of if-then statements that\nexplain why one would expect the independent variables to influence or\ncause the dependent variables. For example, Homans (1950) explained\na theory of interaction:\nIf the frequency of interaction between two or more persons\nincreases, the degree of their liking for one another will",

Persons who feel sentiments of\nliking for one another will express those sentiments in activities\nover and above the activities of the external system, and these\nactivities may further strengthen the sentiments of liking. The\nmore frequently persons interact with one another, the more\nalike in some respects both their activities and their sentiments\ntend to become. (pp. 112, 118, 120)\nThird, an author may present a theory as a visual model. It is helpful to\ntranslate variables into a visual picture. Blalock (1969, 1985, 1991)\nadvocated for causal modeling and recasted verbal theories into causal\nmodels so that a reader could visualize the interconnections of variables.\nTwo simplified examples are presented here. As shown in Figure 3.1,\nthree independent variables influence a single dependent variable,\nmediated by the influence of two intervening variables. A diagram such\nas this shows the possible causal sequence among variables leading to\nmodeling through path analysis and more advanced analyses using\nmultiple measures of variables as found in structural equation modeling\n(see Kline, 1998). At an introductory level, Duncan (1985) provided\nuseful suggestions about the notation for constructing these visual causal\ndiagrams:\nPosition the dependent variables on the right in the diagram and the\nindependent variables on the left.\nUse one-way arrows leading from each determining variable to each\nvariable dependent on it.\nIndicate the strength of the relationship among variables by inserting\nvalence signs on the paths. Use positive or negative valences to\ninfer relationships.\nUse two-headed arrows connected to show unanalyzed\nrelationships between variables not dependent upon other\nrelationships in the model.\nWith additional notation, researchers can construct more complicated\ncausal diagrams.

More\ncomplicated designs employ multiple independent and dependent\nvariables in elaborate models of causation (Blalock, 1969, 1985, 1991).\nFor example, Jungnickel (1990), in a doctoral dissertation proposal\nabout research productivity among faculty in pharmacy schools,\npresented a complex visual model, as shown in Figure 3.3. Jungnickel\nasked what factors influence a faculty member’s scholarly research\nperformance. After identifying these factors in the literature, he adapted\na theoretical framework found in nursing research (Megel et al., 1987)\nand developed a visual model portraying the relationship among these\nfactors, following the rules for constructing a model introduced earlier.\nHe listed the independent variables on the far left, the intervening\nvariables in the middle, and the dependent variables on the right. The\ndirection of influence flowed from the left to the right, and he used plus\nand minus signs to indicate the hypothesized direction. In this figure, an\nendogenous variable means that variables influence other variables. In\nthis example, tenure standards and type of faculty appointment influence\nworkload and pressure to conduct research. Arrows in the diagram\nshow this relationship. An exogeneous variable is one not caused by\nother variables in the causal model. In Figure 3.3, prior research training\nor type of appointment are exogenous variables, for example.\nPlacement of Quantitative Theories\nWhere are theories placed in a quantitative a research study? In\nquantitative studies, one uses theory deductively and places it toward\nthe beginning of the proposed study. With the objective of testing or\nverifying a theory, the researcher advances a theory, collects data to\ntest it, and reflects on its confirmation or disconfirmation. The theory\nbecomes a framework for the entire study, an organizing model for the\nresearch questions or hypotheses and for the data collection procedure.\nThe deductive model of thinking used in a quantitative study is shown in\nFigure 3.4.

In addition, the learning\nprinciples of this theory place special emphasis on the important\nroles played by vicarious, symbolic, and self-regulating\nprocesses (Bandura, 1971).\nSocial learning theory not only deals with learning, but also seeks\nto describe how a group of social and personal competencies (so\ncalled personality) could evolve out of social conditions within\nwhich the learning occurs. It also addresses techniques of\npersonality assessment (Mischel, 1968), and behavior\nmodification in clinical and educational settings (Bandura, 1977;\nBower & Hilgard, 1981; Rotter, 1954).

Scholarly productivity is the desired behavior or activity.\n2. Locus of control is the generalized expectancy whether\nrewards are or are not dependent upon specific behaviors.\n3. Reinforcements are the rewards from scholarly work and the\nvalue attached to these rewards.\n4.

For example, ethnographers\nemploy cultural themes or aspects to study in their qualitative projects,\nsuch as social control, language, stability and change, or social\norganization, such as kinship or families (see Wolcott’s 2008 discussion\nabout texts addressing cultural topics in anthropology). Themes in this\ncontext provide a ready-made series of hypotheses tested from the\nliterature. Anthropologists use broad explanations to study the culture-\nsharing behavior and attitudes of people. This approach is popular in\nqualitative health science research. Investigators begin with a theoretical\nor conceptual model, such as the adoption of health practices or an\nassessment of the quality of life.\nSecond, researchers increasingly use a theoretical standpoint in\nqualitative research to provide an overall orienting lens for the study\nquestions about gender, class, and race (or other issues of marginalized\ngroups). This lens becomes a transformative perspective to bring about\nchange, lift the voices of underrepresented groups, and uncover largely\nhidden assumptions of individuals. It shapes the questions asked,\ninforms how data are collected and analyzed, and provides a call for\naction or change.\nQualitative research in the 1980s transformed by broadening its scope\nof inquiry and including theoretical lenses. The standpoint guides\nresearchers about important issues to examine (e.g., marginalization,\nempowerment, oppression, power) and people studied (e.g., women,\nlow economic social status, ethnic and racial groups, sexual orientation,\ndisability). It also indicates how the researchers position themselves in\nthe qualitative study (e.g., up front or biased from personal, cultural, and\nhistorical contexts) and in the final report (e.g., without further\nmarginalizing individuals, by collaborating with participants) suggesting\nrecommendations for changes to improve lives and society.

(p.\n91)\nThird, distinct from the deductive use and theoretical standpoint\norientation, qualitative studies apply theory as a theoretical end point for\na study. This theoretical end point means that the qualitative study\nends with a theoretical model, a theory, or a conceptual model.\nQualitative research is an inductive process building from data, to broad\nthemes, and to a generalized model or theory (see Punch, 2014). The\nlogic of this inductive approach is shown in Figure 3.5.\nThe researcher begins by gathering detailed information from\nparticipants and then forms this information into categories or themes.\nThese themes are developed into broad patterns, theories, or\ngeneralizations and compared with personal experiences or with existing\nliterature on the topic.\nThe development of themes and categories into patterns, theories, or\ngeneralizations suggests varied end points for qualitative studies. For\nexample, in case study research, Stake (1995) adds to a propositional\ngeneralization (the researcher’s summary of interpretations and claims)\nthe researcher’s own personal experiences, called “naturalistic\ngeneralizations” (p. 86). As another example, grounded theory provides\na different end point. Inquirers plan to discover and advance a theory\ngrounded in information from participants (Strauss & Corbin, 1998).\nLincoln and Guba (1985) referred to “pattern theories” as explanations\ndeveloping during naturalistic or qualitative research. Rather than the\ndeductive form found in quantitative studies, these pattern theories or\ngeneralizations represent interconnected thoughts or parts linked to a\nwhole.",

Still, in some qualitative\nstudies one sees no explicit theoretical orientation, such as in\nphenomenology, in which inquirers attempt to build the essence of\nexperience from participants (e.g., see Riemen, 1986).

The theory may\nappear at a study’s beginning and be modified or adjusted based on\nparticipant views. Lather (1986) qualified the use of theory in grounded\ntheory studies:\nBuilding empirically grounded theory requires a reciprocal\nrelationship between data and theory.

They\nwere curious about how ethnicity influenced social integration,\nand they began by relating the participants’ experiences to a\ntheoretical model, the Tinto model of social integration. They felt\nthe model had been “incompletely conceptualized and, as a\nconsequence, only imprecisely understood and measured” (p.\n433).\nThus, the model was not tested, as one would find in a\nquantitative project, but modified.

It\nis important to use a theory in mixed methods research and distinguish\nbetween the use of a worldview and a theory.\nTypes of Mixed Methods Theory Use\nThere are two types of theory use in mixed methods studies: discipline-\nbased and social justice. Both forms have emerged in the mixed\nmethods literature (see Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018).\nThe theory can be considered a discipline-based theory drawn from\nthe social, behavioral, or health science literature. Examples of\ndiscipline-based theories would be organizational theories, leadership\ntheories, adoption theories, attribution theories, health promotion\ntheories, and the like. These theories typically identify variables or\nconstructs, interrelate them, and form and explain expected results for\nindividuals and organizations.\nAn example of a discipline-based theory in health science is found in a\nmixed methods study about chronic pain and its management through\nlearned resourcefulness by Kennett et al. (2008). These authors\npresented a mixed methods study to understand how learned\nresourcefulness empowers individuals. Specifically, the study examined\nthe impact of a cognitive-behavioral chronic pain management program\non self-management. They also explored how resourcefulness and a\nsense of self-directedness influenced self-management skills for chronic\npain. They used Rosenbaum’s (1990) theory of self-control. They\ngathered quantitative measures on Rosenbaum’s Self-Control Schedule\n(SCS) and collected interviews with patients coping with chronic pain. In\nthe opening paragraph of their study, they advanced the purpose:",

(p. 318)\nFollowing this passage, they advanced a model of learned\nresourcefulness to guide their study. They introduced the major\ncomponents of Rosenbaum’s model. The research literature on\nresourcefulness followed this introduction as an important predictor of\nadopting healthy behavior and included a discussion of a Rosenbaum\nexperiment relating resourcefulness to coping with pain. The authors\nthen discussed the factors of the model leading to self-control, such as\nprocess-regulating cognitions (e.g., supporting family and friends),\ncoping strategies (e.g., ability to cope with such pain), and staying in (or\ndropping out of) programs. The authors at this point might have drawn a\ndiagram of the theory to be explicit about factors influencing self-control.\nHowever, they provided a series of questions drawn from Rosenbaum’s\nmodel and the literature to guide their study. Toward the end of the\narticle, they revisited the factors leading to self-management and\npresented a diagram of the most salient factors.\nThe theory used in a mixed method study could also be a social justice\ntheory, such as feminist research, racial or ethnic research, disability\nresearch, lifestyle research, and the like. These social justice theories\nhelp give voice to populations underrepresented and marginalized in our\nsociety.\nA mixed method article by Hodgkin (2008) illustrates the use of a\nfeminist emancipatory lens in a mixed methods study. Hodgkin examined\nif men and women have different social capital profiles and why women\nparticipated more in social and community activities than in civic activities\nin Australia. Her stated aim was to “demonstrate the use of mixed\nmethods in feminist research” (p. 296). Toward the beginning of her\narticle, she discussed the feminist perspective, such as drawing attention\nto the lack of gender focus in social capital studies, using qualitative and\nquantitative research giving voice to women’s experiences, and locating\nher study within the transformative paradigm (worldview). She found a\ndifference in social capital between men and women in her results.

Morse and Niehaus (2009) contended that mixed\nmethods studies are all theoretically driven. This means that either\nquantitative or qualitative research holds a major emphasis in the study.\nAuthors of mixed methods studies do mention their drive, such as the\nphenomenon of caregiving in Mexican American families (Evans et al.,\n2011). The authors admit to a theoretically driven inductive approach\nbased on the life course perspective (their theoretical perspective). A\nstudy can feature either the quantitative or the qualitative use of theory.\nHowever, it is difficult for a reader of studies to determine the scope of\nthe theory in a study.

This project used the theory of\npositive psychology (a discipline-based theory) as a guiding\nperspective. They augmented it with social cognitive theory, self-\ndetermination theory, and social cognitive career theory. The\nstudy examined the relationship between grit (individual passion\nand perseverance) and career success for working adults.

Evaluate the quality of your writing for conciseness, coherence, and unnecessary words.\n4. Identify ethical issues and strategies for addressing them before conducting a study and\nduring and after a study.\nINTRODUCTION\nBefore designing a proposal, plan the general structure or outline of the topics and their order. The\nstructure differs depending on a quantitative, qualitative, or a mixed methods project. Another\ngeneral consideration is to be aware of good writing practices that will help ensure a consistent and\neasily readable proposal or research project. Affecting all phases of the study will be attending to\ngood ethical practices and anticipating issues. This chapter provides guidance for the overall\nstructure of proposals or projects, writing practices that make projects easy to read, and ethical\nissues that need to be anticipated in research studies.\nWRITING THE PROPOSAL\nBefore writing a proposal for a research study, consider the topics and format for qualitative,\nquantitative, and mixed methods studies.\nTopics Presented in a Proposal\nIt is helpful to consider early in planning a study the major topics that need to be addressed in a\nproposal. These topics need to be interconnected to provide a cohesive picture of the entire project,\nand they span all research studies, whether qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods. A good\nplace to start is examining Maxwell’s (2013) list of the core arguments that need to be advanced in\nany proposal. We summarize them in our own words:\n1. What do readers need to better understand your topic?\n2. What do readers know about your topic?\n3. What do you propose to study?\n4. What is the setting, and who are the people you will study?\n5. What methods do you plan to use to collect data?\n6. How will you analyze the data?\n7. How will you validate your findings?\n8. What ethical issues will your study present?\n9. What do preliminary results show about the feasibility and value of the proposed study?\nIf addressed adequately with a section devoted to each question, these nine questions constitute\nthe foundation of good research, and they provide the overall structure for a proposal. The inclusion\nof validation, ethical considerations, preliminary results, and early evidence of practical significance\nrepresents key elements often overlooked in discussions about proposed projects.",

        "text": "A Qualitative Proposal\nBeyond these nine questions, it is also helpful to have an overall outline or general structure for\ntopics included in a proposal for a study. Unquestionably, in qualitative research, no one structure\nprevails. However, guidance shown in several general outlines can help, especially for a student new\nto the process of writing a thesis or dissertation. Here we propose two alternative qualitative\nmodels. Example 4.1 draws on a constructivist or interpretivist worldview. Example 4.2 is based on\nparticipatory or social justice (see worldviews in Chapter 1).\nExample 4.1 A Qualitative Constructivist or Interpretivist Format\nIntroduction\nStatement of the Problem (including existing literature, deficiencies in the literature, and\nrelevance of study for audiences)\nPurpose of the Study\nThe Research Questions\nPhilosophical Assumptions or Worldview and Theory\nProcedures\nQualitative Design (e.g., descriptive, ethnography, case study)\nRole of the Researcher\nData Collection Procedures\nData Analysis Procedures\nProposed Narrative Structure for Findings\nStrategies for Validation\nAnticipated Ethical Issues\nPreliminary Pilot Findings (if available)\nExpected Impact and Significance of Study\nReferences\nAppendixes: Interview Questions and Protocol, Observational Forms, Timeline for the Study,\nProposed Budget, Summary of the Proposed Content of Each Chapter in the Final Study\nIn this example, the writer includes an introduction, procedures, ethical issues, preliminary findings,\nand the expected impact of the study. A separate section reviewing the literature may be included,\nbut it is optional, as discussed in Chapter 2. Several appendixes may seem unusual. Developing a\ntimeline for the study and presenting a proposed budget provide useful information to committees,\nalthough these sections are optional but highly recommended. Also, because the number and type\nof chapters in qualitative research is highly variable, a summary of each chapter’s content in the final\nstudy is helpful.\nThis format is like the constructivist or interpretivist format except that the inquirer identifies a\nspecific participatory or social justice framework used in the study (e.g., oppression, discrimination,",

This format could make the mixed methods proposal\nlengthier than the qualitative or quantitative proposal.\nDesigning the Sections of a Proposal\nHere are several research tips that we give to students about designing the overall structure of a\nproposal:\nSpecify the sections early in the design of a proposal. Work on one section often prompts ideas\nfor other sections. First develop an outline, and then write something for each section rapidly to\nget ideas down on paper. Then refine the sections as you consider the information that should\ngo into each one in more detail.\nFind proposals that other students have authored under your adviser, and study them closely.\nAsk your advisers for copies of proposals they especially liked and felt were scholarly products\nto take to committees. Examine the topics addressed, their order, and the level of detail used in\ncomposing the proposal.\nDetermine whether your program or institution offers a course on proposal development or\nsome similar topic. Often such a class will be helpful as a support network for your project to\nhave individuals react to your proposal ideas as they develop.\nSit with your adviser, and go over their preferred format for a proposal. Ask this adviser for a\ncopy of a proposal that might serve as a guide and whether there are published scientific\narticles they recommend you study.",

        "text": "Consider the appropriate topics and the length of the proposal that will be acceptable to your\nadviser and committee members. We prefer a proposal that does not exceed 30 pages, but the\nlength will differ by advisers, committees, and institutions. Some advisers and committee\nmembers will expect the first three chapters of the dissertation (introduction, literature review,\nand methods) as a proposal.\nWRITING STRATEGIES\nThe Process\nEarly in the process of research, write ideas down rather than talk about them.\nBailey (1984) discusses how writing down ideas represents good thinking about a project. Zinsser\n(1983) discusses the need to get words out of our heads and onto paper. Advisers react better\nwhen they read the ideas on paper than when they hear and discuss a research topic with a student\nor colleague. When a researcher renders ideas on paper, this process helps visualize the final\nproduct, see how it looks, and begin to clarify ideas. The concept of working ideas out on paper has\nserved many experienced writers well. Before designing a proposal, draft a one- to two-page\noverview of your project, and have your adviser approve the direction of your proposed study. This\ndraft might contain the essential information: the research problem, the purpose of the study, the\ncentral questions, the sources of data, the project’s significance for different audiences, and how\nyou are thinking about the practical issues around completing the project (e.g., a budget, a project\ntimeline, anticipated problems, and how you will address them). It might also be useful to draft\nseveral one- to two-page statements on different topics and see which one your adviser likes best\nand feels would make the best contribution to your field.\nWork through several drafts of a proposal rather than trying to polish the first\ndraft.\nIt is illuminating to see how people think on paper. Zinsser (1983) has identified two types of writers:\n(a) the “bricklayer,” who makes every paragraph just right before going on to the next paragraph,\nand (b) the “let-it-all-hang-out-on-the-first-draft” writer, who writes an entire first draft not caring\nabout sloppy or bad writing. In between these extremes comes a suggestion from Elbow (1973),\nwho recommends the iterative process of writing, reviewing, and rewriting. He has advised this\nprocess: With only 1 hour to write a passage, write four drafts (one every 15 minutes) rather than\none draft (typically written in the last 15 minutes) during the hour. Most experienced researchers\nwrite the first draft carefully but do not work for a polished draft; the polish comes relatively late in\nthe writing process.\nDo not edit your proposal at the early-draft stage. Instead, consider Franklin’s (1986) three-stage\nmodel, which we have found useful in developing proposals and in our scholarly writing:\n1. First, develop an outline; it could be a sentence or word outline or a visual map.\n2. Write out a draft and then shift and sort ideas, moving around entire paragraphs in the\nmanuscript.\n3. Finally, edit and polish each sentence.\nThe Habit of Writing\nEstablish the discipline or habit of writing regularly and continuously. Write some sections of a\nproposal or study, and then set them aside. A researcher gains perspective when returning to the\nstudy after a short break. Further, a start-and-stop process of writing often disrupts the flow of\nwork. It may turn a well-meaning researcher into a “weekend writer.” This individual works on\nresearch on weekends after finishing the other important work of the week. Continual work on the",

We adapted Boice’s (1990, pp. 77–78) ideas about establishing\ngood writing habits:\nSet a priority on writing, and make it a daily activity, regardless of mood or readiness to write.\nIf you feel you do not have time for regular writing, begin with reflection on daily activities for a\nweek or two in half-hour blocks. This reflection will likely lead to time to write.\nWrite while you are fresh during the day or night.\nAvoid writing in binges.\nWrite in small, regular amounts.\nSchedule writing tasks so that you plan to work on specific, manageable units of writing in each\nsession.\nKeep daily charts. Graph at least three things: (a) time spent writing, (b) page equivalents\nfinished, and (c) percentage of planned task completed.\nPlan beyond daily goals.\nShare your writing with supportive, constructive friends until you feel ready to go public.\nConsider also the writing implements and the physical location aiding the process of disciplined\nwriting. The implements—an online dictionary and a thesaurus, a tablet for jotting down thoughts, a\ncup of coffee, and a handful of crackers (Wolcott, 2009). A favorite fountain pen offers the writer\noptions and comfortable ways to write. Consider adding a grammar-checking computer application\nto assist in cleaning up the writing. The physical setting can also help. Annie Dillard (1989), the\nPulitzer Prize–winning novelist, avoided appealing workplaces:\nOne wants a room with no view, so imagination can meet memory in the dark. When I\nfurnished this study seven years ago, I pushed the long desk against a blank wall, so I\ncould not see from either window. Once, fifteen years ago, I wrote in a cinder-block cell\nover a parking lot. It overlooked a tar-and-gravel roof. This pine shed under trees is not\nquite so good as the cinder-block study was, but it will do. (pp. 26–27)\nClear and Concise Writing\nBefore beginning the writing, consider enhancing the readability of the manuscript. The Publication\nManual of the American Psychological Association (American Psychological Association, 2020)\ndiscusses an orderly presentation by showing the relationships between ideas and the use of\ntransitional words. In addition, it is important to use consistent terms, a staging and foreshadowing\nof ideas, and coherence built into the plan.\nUse consistent terms throughout the proposal. In a quantitative study, use a consistent name for\nmentioning variables. In qualitative research, state the same name for the central phenomena each\ntime. Refrain from using synonyms for these names, a problem that causes the reader to\nmisunderstand ideas and monitor subtle shifts in meaning. When terms shift, even slightly, it throws\nthe reader off and causes them to question the research.",

        "text": "Consider how narrative thoughts of different types guide a reader. Tarshis (1982) advanced the idea\nthat writers should have in mind the purpose of different-sized narrative thoughts and purposes for\nsegments of text. He said there were four types:\n1. Umbrella thoughts: the general or core ideas one is trying to get across\n2. Big thoughts in writing: specific ideas or images that fall within the realm of umbrella thoughts\nand serve to reinforce, clarify, or elaborate upon the umbrella thoughts\n3. Little thoughts: ideas or images whose chief function is to reinforce big thoughts\n4. Attention or interest thoughts: ideas whose purposes are to keep the reader on track, organize\nideas, and keep an individual’s attention\nBeginning researchers often struggle most with umbrella and attention thoughts. A proposal may\ninclude too many umbrella ideas with content not sufficiently detailed to support large ideas. This\nmight occur in a literature review in which the researcher needs to provide fewer small sections and\nmore larger sections to tie together large bodies of literature. A clear mark of this problem is a\ncontinual shift of ideas from one major topic to another in a manuscript. Often, one sees short,\nunconnected paragraphs in introductions to proposals, like those written by journalists in newspaper\narticles. Thinking in terms of a detailed narrative to support umbrella ideas may help this problem.\nAttention thoughts that provide organizational statements to guide the reader are also needed.\nReaders can use road signs to guide them from one major idea to the next (Chapters 6 and 7 of this\nbook discuss major road signs in research, such as purpose statements and research questions and\nhypotheses). An organizing paragraph is often useful at the beginning and end of literature reviews.\nReaders need to see the overall organization of the ideas through introductory paragraphs that\nhelps them understand the most salient points they should remember in a summary. The example of\na good proposal or application for federal funding comes to mind. In these applications, researchers\npause the narrative from time to time to provide attention thoughts that organize a reader to see\nmaterial to come next.\nCoherence\nUse coherence to add to the readability of the manuscript. Coherence in writing means that ideas\ntie together, logically flow from one sentence to another, and connect from one paragraph to\nanother. For example, the repetition of the same variable names in the title, the purpose statement,\nthe research questions, and the review of the literature headings in a quantitative project add to\ncoherence. Likewise, emphasizing a consistent order for presenting independent and dependent\nvariables contributes to a coherent research proposal.\nOn a more detailed level, coherence builds through connecting sentences and paragraphs in the\nmanuscript. Zinsser (1983) has suggested that every sentence should be a logical sequel to the one\nthat preceded it. The hook-and-eye exercise (Wilkinson, 1991) is useful for connecting thoughts\nfrom sentence to sentence and paragraph to paragraph. The researcher examines their writing,\ncircles key ideas in each sentence, and then connects the sentences (or paragraphs) with a line. A\ngood connection indicates coherence; a difficult connection shows a lack of coherence. Specific\nwords provide this linkage.\nThe passage in Figure 4.1 from a draft of a student’s proposal shows a high level of coherence. It\ncomes from the introductory section of a qualitative dissertation project about at-risk students. In\nthis passage, we draw hooks and eyes to connect the words from sentence to sentence and from\nparagraph to paragraph. In this example, we were able to identify key ideas (“eyes”) and “hook” the\nideas within sentences and paragraphs. If we had found little coherence, the researcher would need\nto add transitional words, phrases, or sentences to establish clear connections. This connection\npertains to connected chapters as well as sentences and paragraphs. Examine McPherson’s (1988)\nbook about the Civil War, The Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era. He does a masterful job of\nending a chapter with ideas that naturally lead into the next chapter.",

        "text": "Publication Manual (American Psychological Association, 2020), but we include this section to\nhighlight some common grammar issues that we have seen in student proposals and in our writing.\nWe direct our discussion now toward the “polish” level of writing, to use Franklin’s (1986) term. It is\na stage addressed late in the writing process. One can find many writing books about research\nwriting and literary writing with rules and principles following good sentence construction and word\nchoice. Wolcott (2009), a qualitative ethnographer, for example, talks about honing editorial skills to\neliminate unnecessary words (keeping the essential words), deleting the passive voice (using the\nactive voice), and scaling down qualifiers (keeping only one qualifier at best). He also recommends\neliminating overused phrases (completely striking these out) and reducing excessive quotations,\nitalics, and parenthetical comments. The following additional ideas about active voice, verb tense,\nand reduced fat can strengthen and invigorate scholarly writing for dissertation and thesis proposals\nand projects.\nUse the active voice as much as possible in scholarly writing (American Psychological\nAssociation, 2020). According to the literary writer Ross-Larson (1982), “If the subject acts, the\nvoice is active. If the subject is acted on, the voice is passive” (p. 29). In addition, a sign of\npassive construction is some variation of an auxiliary verb, such as was, will be, have been,\nand is being. Writers can use passive construction when the person acting can logically be left\nout of the sentence and when what is acted on is the subject of the rest of the paragraph\n(Ross-Larson, 1982).\nUse strong active verbs appropriate for the passage. Lazy verbs lack action, commonly called\n“to be” verbs, such as is or was, or verbs turned into adjectives or adverbs.\nPay close attention to the tense of your verbs. A common practice exists in using the past tense\nto review the literature and report results of past studies. The past tense represents a\ncommonly used form in quantitative research. The future tense appropriately indicates that the\nstudy will be conducted in the future, a key verb used in proposals. Use the present tense to\nadd clarity to a study, especially in the introduction. This tense form frequently occurs in\nqualitative studies. In mixed methods studies, researchers employ either the present or past\ntense. The appropriate tense often reflects whether the major orientation of the study will be\nquantitative or qualitative research (thus emphasizing one or the other in a study). The APA\nPublication Manual (American Psychological Association, 2020) recommends the past tense\n(e.g., “Jones reported”) or the present perfect tense (e.g., “Researchers have reported”) for\nthe literature review and procedures based on past events, the past tense to describe results\n(e.g., “stress lowered self-esteem”), and the present tense (e.g., “the qualitative findings\nshow”) to discuss the results and to present the conclusions. We see this not as a hard and\nfast rule but as a useful guideline.\nExpect to edit and revise drafts of a manuscript to trim the fat. Fat refers to additional words\nthat are unnecessary to convey the meaning of ideas and need to be removed. Writing multiple\ndrafts of a manuscript is standard practice for most writers. The process typically comprises\nwriting, reviewing, and editing. In the editing process, trim excess words from sentences, such\nas piled-up modifiers, excessive prepositions, and “the-of” constructions—for example, “the\nstudy of”—that add unnecessary verbiage (Ross-Larson, 1982). We were reminded of the\nunnecessary prose that comes into writing by the example mentioned by Bunge (1985):\nNowadays you can almost see bright people struggling to reinvent the complex\nsentence before your eyes. A friend of mine who is a college administrator every now\nand then has to say a complex sentence, and he will get into one of those morasses\nthat begins, “I would hope that we would be able. . . .” He never talked that way when\nI first met him, but even at his age, at his distance from the crisis in the lives of\nyounger people, he’s been to some extent alienated from easy speech.

When using mixed\nmethods research, examine journals that report studies with combined qualitative and quantitative\nresearch and data. Examine social science journals, such as the Journal of Mixed Methods\nResearch, The International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches, Field Methods, Quality and\nQuantity, and the International Journal of Social Research Methodology. Examine numerous\narticles cited in the SAGE Handbook of Mixed Methods in Social and Behavioral Research\n(Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010) and in The Mixed Methods Reader (Plano Clark & Creswell, 2008).\nETHICAL ISSUES\nIn addition to conceptualizing the writing process for a proposal or study, researchers need to\nanticipate the ethical issues and devise strategies for addressing them (Berg, 2001; Hesse-Biber &\nLeavy, 2011; Punch, 2005; Sieber, 1998). Research involves collecting data from and about people\n(Punch, 2014), leading to difficult ethical issues. Writing about these ethical issues is a cornerstone\nof good research writing. As shown in Table 4.1, attention needs to be directed toward ethical\nissues prior to or before conducting the study, beginning a study, during data collection and data\nanalysis, and in reporting, disseminating, and storing the data. Ethical issues arise in qualitative,\nquantitative, and mixed methods research and all stages of research.\nTable 4.1 Ethical Issues in Qualitative, Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Research",

IRB committees exist on campuses because of federal\nregulations that protect against human rights violations. Approval is needed by the IRB before data\ncollection occurs. The IRB committee requires the researcher to assess participant potential risk,\nsuch as physical, psychological, social, economic, or legal harm (Sieber, 1998). Also, the\nresearcher needs to consider the special needs of vulnerable populations, such as minors (under the\nage of 19), mentally incompetent participants, victims, persons with neurological impairments,\npregnant women or fetuses, prisoners, and individuals with AIDS. Before the study begins\nresearchers file an application with the IRB that contains procedures and information about\nparticipants. The committee reviews the extent to which participants are at risk in the study. In\naddition to this application, researchers need to have participants sign informed consent forms\nagreeing to the provisions of the study before they provide data. This form contains a standard set\nof elements that acknowledges protection of human rights. They include the following (Sarantakos,\n2005):\nIdentification of the researcher\nIdentification of the sponsoring institution\nIdentification of the purpose of the study\nIdentification of the benefits for participating\nIdentification of the level and type of participants’ involvement\nStatements of potential risks to participants\nGuarantees of confidentiality to the participants\nAssurance that participants can withdraw at any time\nNames of persons to contact if questions arise\nObtain Necessary Permissions.\nPrior to the study, researchers need to obtain approval of individuals in authority (e.g., gatekeepers)\nto access sites and study participants. This approval often involves writing a letter specifying the\nextent of time, potential impact, and research outcomes.

It does not allow for\nquantitative objectivity or full expression of qualitative multiple perspectives. Select sites that will not\nraise these questions of power and influence in your study.\nNegotiate Authorship for Publication.\nIf planning to publish your study (e.g., a dissertation project), negotiate authorship order and\ninvolvement before beginning the study. Order of authorship typically follows individuals’ contributions\nto the study. Israel and Hay (2006) have discussed the unethical practice of “gift authorship” where\nindividuals receive authorship who do not contribute to a manuscript. They also discuss “ghost\nauthorship,” where researchers omit junior staff who made significant contributions from the list of\nauthors. The inclusion of authors and the order of authorship may change during a study, but a\npreliminary understanding early in the project helps address this issue before publication.\nBeginning the Study\nIdentify a Beneficial Problem.\nWhen studying a research problem, identify a problem beneficial to participants and one meaningful\nto others besides the researcher (Punch, 2014). Hesse-Biber and Leavy (2011) raise awareness of\nthis issue when they ask, “How do ethical issues enter into your selection of a research problem?”\n(p. 86). To identify the best problem to study, proposal developers often conduct pilot projects or a\nneeds assessment or hold informal conversations with participants. Such strategies help detect any\npotential marginalization of participants through the research before the study begins.\nDisclose the Purpose of the Study.\nIn developing the purpose statement or the central intent and questions for a study, proposal\ndevelopers need to describe the purpose of the study to participants (Sarantakos, 2005). Deception\noccurs when participants understand one purpose, but the researcher holds a different purpose.\nAnother disclosure is the specification of the study’s sponsors. Such disclosure can occur by\ndesigning cover letters inviting participants to a study with sponsors’ names attached.\nDo Not Pressure Participants to Sign Consent Forms.\nThe researcher should not require participants to sign the informed consent form when collecting\nconsent for a study. Participation in a study is voluntary, and this needs explanation in the informed\nconsent form instructions.\nRespect Norms and Charters of Indigenous Cultures.\nThe researcher needs to anticipate and respect cultural, religious, gender, or other differences in the\nparticipants and sites. Recent discussions about the norms and charters of indigenous populations,\nsuch as Native American tribes, need to be observed (LaFrance & Crazy Bull, 2009). As Native\nAmericans take over the delivery of services to members, they have reclaimed their right to approve\nresearch and its report in a sensitive way to tribal culture and charters. Respect also occurs through\nresearch approaches such as refraining from using the language of the dominant culture (instead of\nindigenous gestures, tone, expressions) and emphasizing cultural conversational methods (e.g.,\ntalking circles, storytelling). It also occurs through seeking out wise “knowers” of the language,",

Researchers should be\naccountable and respectful, reciprocate for visiting the people and sites, and observe indigenous\nrights and regulations of participants (Chilisa & Tsheko, 2014).\nAssess the Burden of the Research on Participants.\nAnother respectful strategy is to respect the potential burden the research places on participants.\nAll forms of research place a burden on participants, but often an undue burden occurs when the\nresearcher collects multiple forms of data. In mixed methods, strategies need to be planned to use\nshort and brief instruments to collect data, pilot-test user acceptability of data collection, provide\ncompensation for participants’ time, and gather data at convenient times for participants (Stadnick\net al., 2021).\nCollecting the Data\nRespect the Site, and Disrupt as Little as Possible.\nResearchers need to respect research sites and leave them undisturbed after a study. This requires\nthat inquirers, especially in qualitative studies involving prolonged observation or interviewing at a\nsite, be aware of their impact and minimize their disruption of the physical setting. For example, they\nmight time visits to not disrupt the flow of participant activities. Also, consult organizational guidelines\nthat provide advice conducting research without disturbing settings.\nMake Sure That All Participants Receive the Benefits.\nIn experimental studies, investigators can collect data so that all participants benefit from the\ntreatments, not only an experimental group. This requires providing some treatment to all groups or\nstaging the treatment so that ultimately all groups receive the beneficial treatment (e.g., a wait-list).\nFurther, both the researcher and the participants should benefit from the research.\nCollaborate With Participants.\nIn some situations, the abuse of power occurs when researchers coerce participants to be involved\nin projects. Involving individuals collaboratively in the research provides reciprocity. Collaboration\nwith groups and populations and using networks helps recruiting diverse and special populations\n(Stadnick et al., 2021). Collaboration in qualitative research means involving participants throughout\nthe research process, such as in design, data collection and analysis, report writing, and\ndissemination of the findings (Patton, 2002).\nAvoid Deceptive Practices.\nParticipants need to know that they are actively participating in a research study. To counteract this\nproblem, provide instructions that remind the participants about the purpose before the study\nbegins.\nRespect Potential Power Imbalances.\nInterviews (and observations) should begin from the premise that a power imbalance exists between\nthe data collector and the participants.",

Further, readers might critically\nquestion interviewees’ comments, leading to difficult consequences for those interviewed.\nAvoid Exploitation of Participants.\nResearchers need to consider how they will give back to participants. Reciprocity can be offered by\nproviding a small reward for participation, sharing the final research report, and involving participants\nas collaborators. Some researchers have taken advantage of participants by gathering data and\nabruptly leaving the research site. This results in participant exploitation. Rewards and appreciation\nprovide respect and reciprocity for those who provide valuable data.\nAvoid Collecting Harmful Information.\nThe possibility of gathering harmful, intimate information during data collection and disclosing it later\npresents a problem. A researcher’s challenge is anticipating and planning the impact of information\nduring or after an interview (Patton, 2002). For example, a student may discuss parental abuse, or\nprisoners may talk about an escape. Typically, in these situations, the ethical code for researchers\n(which may be different for schools and prisons) protects the privacy of the participants and\nindividuals involved in a study.\nAnalyzing the Data\nAvoid Taking Sides.\nIt is easy for researchers to support and embrace the perspectives of participants in a study. In\nqualitative studies, this means “taking sides” and reporting only results that place the participants in\na favorable light. In quantitative research, it means disregarding data that proves or disproves\npersonal hypotheses held by the researcher.\nAvoid Disclosing Only Positive Results.\nIn research, it is academically dishonest to withhold important results or to cast the results in a\nfavorable light for participants or readers. In qualitative research, the inquirer needs to report the full\nrange of findings, including results contrary to the themes. A good qualitative study includes the\ndiversity of participant perspectives. In quantitative research, the data analysis should reflect the\nstatistical tests and not be underreported.\nRespect the Privacy of Participants.\nIn analyzing the data and reporting results, protect the anonymity of individuals, roles, and incidents.\nFor example, in survey research, investigators disassociate names from responses during the\ncoding and recording process. In qualitative research, inquirers use aliases or pseudonyms for\nindividuals and places.\nReporting, Sharing, and Storing Data\nProvide an Accurate Account of Information.",

        "text": "In interpreting data, researchers should provide an accurate account of the information. This\naccuracy may involve debriefing between the researcher and participants in quantitative research\n(Berg, 2001). In qualitative research, validity strategies (see Chapter 9) help the accuracy of an\naccount. Other ethical issues in reporting research involve the potential of suppressing, falsifying, or\ninventing findings to meet a researcher’s or an audience’s needs. Professional research\ncommunities find these fraudulent practices unacceptable. They constitute scientific misconduct\n(Neuman, 2009).\nDo Not Plagiarize.\nCopying extensive material from others is an ethical problem. Researchers should give credit for the\nwork of others. Use quotation marks and page numbers to set off the exact words of others. The\nkey idea is to not present the work of another as your own (American Psychological Association,\n2020). A paraphrase of sentences from others deserves a citation. Journals typically have\nguidelines for seeking permissions from publishers for information borrowed.\nAvoid Disclosing Harmful Information.\nOne issue to anticipate about confidentiality is that some participants may not want to disclose their\nidentity. By honoring this need, the researcher allows the participants to retain ownership of their\nvoices and exert their independent decision-making. Participants should be informed about the risks\nof non-confidentiality, such as the inclusion of data in the final report. Participants may not\nappreciate disclosing information they wanted concealed (Giordano et al., 2007). In planning a\nstudy, anticipate the repercussions of conducting the research on participants and privileging the\nresults of one group or another.\nCommunicate in Clear Language.\nReport in the results bias-free and non-discriminatory language. Clear guidelines are available in the\nPublication Manual (American Psychological Association, 2020). We briefly introduced in the\ndiscussion about abstracting the literature in Chapter 2. For example, when reporting the results\nabout age, indicate exact ages or age ranges. When reporting on disabilities, mention specific\nnames of conditions (e.g., people with intellectual disabilities). In writing about gender, include\ndescriptors with modifiers rather than general categories (e.g., disenfranchised women rather than\nwomen). For racial or ethnic groups, use specific regions of origin rather than generalized origin\n(e.g., Japanese Americans rather than Asian Americans). When reporting about sexual orientation,\nmention the specific names of orientation rather than broad groups (e.g., gay men rather than\nhomosexuals). When writing about socioeconomic status, indicate specific designations rather than\ngeneral labels (e.g., below the federal level of poverty for a family of six rather than low income).\nShare Data With Others.\nRelease the details of the research with the study design so that readers can determine the\ncredibility of the study (Neuman, 2009). Strategies for sharing include engaging with stakeholders in\nthe dissemination process, revisiting authorship agreements, providing copies of reports to\nparticipants and stakeholders, making distributions of reports available on websites, and publishing\nstudies in multiple languages (see Stadnick et al., 2021).\nKeep Raw Data and Other Materials.\nData, once analyzed, needs to be kept for a reasonable period. Sieber (1998) recommends 5 to 10\nyears; most guidelines recommend 5 years. For example, this material comprises details of",

After this period, investigators discard the data so that it\ndoes not fall into the hands of other researchers who might misuse it.\nDo Not Duplicate or Piecemeal Publications.\nResearchers should not publish papers with duplicate or redundant information from a study. This\nduplication comprises presenting the same data, discussions, and conclusions without offering new\nmaterial. Some biomedical journals now require authors to declare whether they have published or\nare preparing to publish papers closely related to the manuscript submitted (Israel & Hay, 2006).\nComplete Proof of Compliance and Lack of Conflict of Interest.\nSome academic campuses require authors to file statements indicating that they do not have a\nconflict of interest in publishing the research. Such conflict might arise from research payments,\nvested interests in the outcome of the data, or the misappropriation of research for personal use.\nComply with requests for disclosure about potential conflicts of interests that surround your\nresearch.\nUnderstand Who Owns the Data.\nOwnership of the data, once it is collected and analyzed, represents another ethical issue. The\nownership question can split research teams and divide individuals against each other. A research\nproposal might mention this issue of ownership and discuss how it will be resolved, such as\ndeveloping a clear understanding among the researcher, the participants, and the faculty advisers\n(Punch, 2014).

Good writing\nstrategies include thinking through ideas by putting them down on paper and establishing the\nhabit of routine writing. Be consistent in linking the sentences, paragraphs, and chapters in a\nresearch study. A good narrative structure is to write using umbrella thoughts, big thoughts,\nlittle thoughts, and especially attention or interest thoughts to keep the reader on track. Also\nuse the active voice, use strong verbs, and revise and edit to strengthen your prose.\nThroughout the entire writing process and engaging in research, anticipate and address\npotential ethical issues.

Describe reasons for an introduction’s role as a key feature of a study.\n3. Compare an introduction for a qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods study.\n4. Describe the four components of a good introduction to a study.\nINTRODUCTION TO A STUDY\nWe have discussed how to choose a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods approach; conduct a\npreliminary literature review; and structure the format for a research project. After these preliminary\nsteps, it is important to plan the study and write the plan’s sections. We start by designing an\nintroduction. This chapter begins by discussing the importance of a good introduction. Then we compare\nthe differences in writing an introduction for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies. Central\nto writing a good introduction is the structure for organizing it. We present a template for an introduction,\ncalled a deficiencies model for an introduction. This model contains four parts, stating: (a) the\nresearch problem, (b) evidence from the literature justifying the problem, (c) deficiencies in the evidence,\nand (d) the importance of the problem for audiences. We call this model a deficiency model because a\nmajor component of the introduction establishes the deficiencies in past research. To illustrate this model,\nwe present an example of a study that uses this template.\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF INTRODUCTIONS\nAn introduction is the first passage in a journal article, dissertation, or scholarly research study. It sets the\nstage for the entire project. Wilkinson (1991) said the following:\nThe introduction is the part of the paper that provides readers with the background information\nfor the research reported in the paper. Its purpose is to establish a framework for the research,\nso that readers can understand how it is related to other research. (p. 96)\nThe introduction establishes the issue or concern leading to the research by conveying information about\na problem. Because it is the initial passage in a study or proposal, it requires special attention. It must\ncreate reader interest in the topic, establish the problem that leads to the study, place the study within\nthe larger context of the scholarly literature, and reach out to audiences. These sections need to fit into a\nconcise section of a few pages.\nA research problem is the problem or issue that leads to the need for a study. It can originate from many\npotential sources. It might spring from researchers’ experiences in their personal lives or workplaces or\ncome from debates in the literature. These debates often illustrate a gap in the literature, seek to resolve\nalternative perspectives, or extend the discussion. Further, the research problem sometimes develops\nfrom policy debates in government or among top executives.\nRegardless of the source, researchers often state multiple research problems leading to a study.\nStating a clear problem is challenging. First, too often researchers identify what exists in the literature\nrather than identifying a problem that requires a solution. For example, a researcher could cite the\nimportance of teenage pregnancy by conveying its prevalence. This statement is not a problem. Rather, a\nproblem might be that schools have done a poor job of accommodating pregnant teenagers. We\nrecommend not simply stating the facts about a situation but thinking deeply about the underlying problem\nthat exists.",

        "text": "Second, when authors do not clearly identify the research problem, readers must decide for themselves\nthe importance of the study. If a study starts poorly without a clear problem, the reader may wonder why\nit is important to examine and cease to read the study to its conclusion. Third, the research problem\ndiffers from the research questions. The research problem is a problem or issue, whereas research\nquestions raise questions to be answered by gathering and analyzing data. Fourth, introductions carry the\nweight of encouraging the reader to read further.\nFortunately, there is a model for writing a good, scholarly introduction. Before introducing this model, it is\nnecessary to briefly discuss the composition of a good abstract that precedes an introduction and then to\ndistinguish subtle differences between introductions for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods\nstudies.\nAN ABSTRACT FOR A STUDY\nAn abstract summarizes the contents of a study and allows readers to identify the essential elements of a\nproject quickly. It is placed at the beginning of studies, and we find abstracts in study proposals, theses,\nand dissertations. The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (American\nPsychological Association, 2020) states that the abstract can be the most important single paragraph in a\nstudy. It needs to be accurate, non-evaluative (by not adding comments beyond the scope of the\nresearch), coherent, readable, and concise. Its length varies, and some colleges and universities have\nrequirements for an appropriate length.\nThe APA Publication Manual guidelines say that most abstracts are about 250 words. The Publication\nManual also includes standards for content for abstracts in different paper types. These paper types are\nempirical, replication, quantitative or qualitative meta-analyses, literature review, theoretical, and\nmethodological articles. We will focus here on the abstract for a proposal for an empirical (data-based)\narticle. We see several major components as part of the abstract, and these would be the same whether\nthe proposal is quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods. Also, we would present these components in\nthe order that follows:\n1. Start with the issue or problem under investigation. This issue might need more literature or a real-\nlife problem (e.g., reaction to vaccines). Cite a reference or two about this problem, but the abstract\nis too short to include many references.\n2. Indicate data sources and pertinent characteristics.\n3. State the essential features of the study method (i.e., design, analysis, data gathering, sample size,\nmaterials, and whether the methods involve secondary analysis).\n4. Convey the basic findings. For quantitative analysis, include effect sizes, confidence intervals, and\nstatistical significance levels. For qualitative methods, indicate main findings and contexts.\n5. Finish with conclusions and implications or applications of the research findings.\nThis example illustrates the essential components in an abstract for an empirical (data-based) study. We\nwould add to this list a purpose statement following the problem statement.\nHere is an example of a short abstract for a qualitative study that contains all five elements.\nThe issue that this study addresses is the lack of women in martial arts competitions. To\naddress this problem, the purpose of this study will be exploring motivation of female athletes in\nTae Kwon Do competitions. To gather data, interviews with 4 female Tae Kwon Do tournament\ncompetitors were conducted. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed. This data leads to\nthe following 3 themes: social support, self-efficacy, and goal orientation. These themes will be\nuseful for understanding the optimal way to increase motivation in female martial artists. (Witte,\n2011, personal communication)\nQUALITATIVE, QUANTITATIVE, AND MIXED METHODS\nINTRODUCTIONS\nA general review of introductions shows that they follow a similar pattern: the author announces a\nproblem and justifies why it needs to be studied.

        "text": "vary depending on the approach (see Chapter 1).\nQuantitative introductions typically present a set structure. In a quantitative project, problems often arise\nfrom a need to understand what factors or variables influence an outcome. For example, in response to\nworker cutbacks (a problem for all employees), an investigator may seek to discover what factors\ninfluence businesses to downsize. Another researcher may seek to understand the high divorce rate\namong married couples (a problem) and examine whether financial issues contribute to divorce. In both\nsituations, the research problem is one in which understanding the factors that explain or relate to an\noutcome helps the investigator best understand and explain the problem. In addition, in quantitative\nintroductions, researchers seek to improve and test a theory. As such, an established theory is\ndescribed, and then literature is described that challenges or extends the theory. A quantitative\nintroduction may be written from an impersonal point of view and use sentences posed in the past tense\nto convey objectivity.\nA qualitative introduction presents a varied structure. In a qualitative project the author will describe a\nresearch problem that can best be understood by exploring a concept or phenomenon.\nWe have suggested that qualitative research is exploratory, and researchers use it to probe a topic when\nthe variables, questions, and theory are unknown. For example, Morse (1991) said:\nCharacteristics of a qualitative research problem are: (a) the concept is “immature” due to a\nconspicuous lack of theory and previous research; (b) a notion that the available theory may be\ninaccurate, inappropriate, incorrect, or biased; (c) a need exists to explore and describe the\nphenomena and to develop theory; or (d) the nature of the phenomenon may not be suited to\nquantitative measures. (p. 120)\nFor example, urban sprawl (a problem) needs exploration because it has not been examined in certain\nareas of a state. Also, kids in elementary classrooms have anxiety that interferes with learning (a\nproblem), and the best way to explore this problem is to go to schools and visit directly with teachers and\nstudents. Some qualitative researchers use a transformative lens to examine the problem (e.g., the\ninequality of pay among women and men or the racial attitudes involved in profiling drivers on the\nhighways). Thomas (1993) suggested that “critical researchers begin from the premise that all cultural life\nis in constant tension between control and resistance” (p. 9). This theoretical orientation shapes the\nstructure of an introduction. In some qualitative studies, the approach in the introduction may be more\ndeductive while relying on participants’ perspectives. In addition, qualitative introductions may begin with a\npersonal statement of experiences from the author, such as those found in phenomenological studies\n(Moustakas, 1994). They may also be written from a personal, first person, subjective point of view in\nwhich researchers position themselves in the narrative.\nA mixed methods study introduction can employ either the qualitative or the quantitative approach (or\nsome combination) to writing an introduction. In a mixed methods study, the emphasis might tip toward\neither quantitative or qualitative research, and the introduction will mirror that emphasis. For other mixed\nmethods projects, the emphasis will be equal between qualitative and quantitative research. In this case,\nthe problem may be one in which a need exists to understand the relationship among variables in a\nsituation quantitatively and to explore the topic in further depth qualitatively. A mixed methods problem\nmay indicate that the existing research is primarily quantitative or qualitative, and a need exists to expand\nthe approach to be more inclusive of diverse methodologies. As an example, a mixed methods project\nmay initially seek to explain the relationship between smoking behavior and depression among\nadolescents, then explore the detailed views of these youth, and display different patterns of smoking\nand depression. With the first quantitative project phase, the introduction may emphasize a quantitative\napproach with a theory that predicts this relationship and a substantive review of the literature.\nA MODEL FOR AN INTRODUCTION\nThese differences among approaches are subtle, and they relate largely to the different types of\nproblems addressed in qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies. Regardless of approach, a\ntemplate for writing an introduction can be useful.\nThe deficiencies model of an introduction is an approach to writing an introduction to a research study\nthat builds on gaps in the literature. It includes the elements of stating the research problem, reviewing",

What effect did this first\nsentence have? Would it entice a reader to read on? Was it pitched at a level so that a wide audience\ncould understand it? These sentences are important for opening statements and represent a narrative\nhook, a term drawn from English composition.\nTable 5.1 Illustration of an Introduction to a Study With Annotated Markers of Components\nExploring the Conceptions and Misconceptions of Teen Smoking in High Schools: A Multiple\nCase Analysis",

        "text": "“Who controls the process of chief executive succession?” (Boeker, 1992, p. 400)\n“There is a large body of literature that studies the cartographic line (a recent summary article is\nButte in field, 1985), and generalization of cartographic lines (McMaster, 1987).” (Carstensen, 1989,\np. 181)\nThese two examples present information easily understood by many readers. The first example\ndemonstrates creating reader interest by posing a question. The second example, from a quantitative-\nexperimental study, illustrates beginning the problem discussion with a literature perspective. Together\nthese examples demonstrate how authors can create a sentence so the reader is not taken into a\ndetailed morass of thought but lowered gently down into the topic.\nWe use the metaphor of the writer lowering a barrel into a well. The beginning writer plunges the barrel\n(the reader) into the depths of the well (the article). The reader sees only unfamiliar material. The\nexperienced writer slowly lowers the barrel (the reader, again), allowing the reader to acclimate to the\ndepths (of the study). This lowering of the barrel begins with a narrative hook of sufficient generality,\nencouraging reader understanding of the topic.\nBeyond this first sentence, it is important to clearly identify the issue(s) or problem(s) that leads to a\nneed for the study. In our example, tobacco use causes cancer and adolescent smoking has increased.\nThese are problems leading to potential health issues. In applied social science research, problems arise\nfrom issues, difficulties, and current practices in real-life situations. The research problem in a study\nbegins to become clear when the researcher asks, “What is the need for my study?” or “What problem\ninfluenced the need to undertake this study?” For example, schools may experience discrimination\nbecause they do not have multicultural guidelines; college adjunct faculty experience financial hardship\nleading to the need for more equitable pay; underrepresented students are barred from universities\nleading to a need to examine admission standards. These are significant research problems meriting\nfurther study and establish a practical problem or concern to be addressed. In designing the opening\nparagraphs of a proposal or study, keep in mind these ideas:\nWrite an opening sentence to stimulate reader interest and convey an issue to which a broad\naudience can relate.\nIn general, refrain from using quotations—especially long ones—in the lead sentence. Such use will\nbe difficult for readers to grasp the key idea you want them to understand. Quotations raise many\npossibilities for interpretation and create unclear beginnings.\nStay away from idiomatic expressions or trite phrases (e.g., “The lecture method remains a ‘third\nrail’ among most college and university instructors.”).\nConsider numeric information for impact (e.g., “Every year, an estimated 5 million Americans\nexperience the death of an immediate family member.”).\nClearly identify the research problem (i.e., dilemma, issue) leading to the study.\nAsk yourself, “Is there a specific sentence (or sentences) in which I convey the research problem?”\nIndicate why the problem is important by citing numerous references to justify the need for the study.\nWe sometimes say to our students that if they do not have a dozen references cited on the first\npage of their proposal, they do not have a scholarly study.\nMake sure that the problem is framed consistently with the approach to research in the study (e.g.,\nexploratory in qualitative, examining relationships or predictors in quantitative, or describing the\nqualitative or quantitative research approaches in mixed methods.\nConsider and identify a single problem or multiple problems leading to a need for the study.

        "text": "After establishing the research problem in the opening paragraphs, Plano Clark et al. (2002) discuss\nprevious research in the literature addressing the problem. They do not include in the introduction a\ncomplete literature review. Later in the literature review section of a proposal researchers thoroughly\nreview the literature. This literature review passage should summarize large groups of studies instead of\ndetailing individual studies in the introduction. We tell students to reflect on their literature maps\n(described in Chapter 2) and look at and summarize the broad categories in the top boxes in the map.\nThese broad categories illustrate large summaries of studies.\nReviewing studies in an introduction justifies the study’s importance and creates distinctions between past\nstudies and the proposed one. This component is called “setting the research problem within the ongoing\ndialogue in the literature.” Researchers do not want to conduct a study that replicates exactly what\nsomeone else has examined. New studies need to add to the literature or to extend or retest what others\nhave investigated. The ability to frame the study in this way separates novices from more experienced\nresearchers. The experienced researcher has reviewed and understands topics or problems in the field.\nThis knowledge comes from years of experience following the development of problems and their\naccompanying literature.\nThe question often arises as to what type of literature to review. Our best advice is to review research\nstudies in which authors advance research questions and report data to answer them (i.e., empirical\narticles). These studies might be quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods studies.\nBeginning researchers often ask, “What do I do now? No research has been conducted on my topic.” Of\ncourse, this situation may be the case in some narrowly construed topics or in new, exploratory projects\nwhere no literature exists to document the research problem. Also, realize that a researcher proposes a\ntopic precisely because little research exists on it. When students say “no research can be found on my\ntopic,” we suggest thinking about the situation using the image of an inverted triangle. The bottom of the\napex of the inverted triangle represents the proposed scholarly study. This study is narrow and focused\n(and studies may not exist on it). If one broadens the review of the literature upward from the base of the\ninverted triangle, literature can be found, although it may be somewhat removed from the study at hand.\nFor example, past research may not address the narrow topic of at-risk children in primary school.\nHowever, more broadly speaking, the topic of at-risk students, generally in the primary school or at any\nlevel in education, may have been studied. The researcher would summarize the more general literature\nand end with statements about narrow studies that examine at-risk students at the primary school level.\nTo review the literature related to the research problem for an introduction to a proposal, consider these\nideas:\nRefer to the literature by summarizing groups, not individual studies (unlike the focus on single\nstudies in the review of the literature in Chapter 2). The intent should be to establish broad areas of\nresearch.\nTo deemphasize single studies, place the in-text references at the end of a paragraph or at the end\nof a summary point about several studies.\nReview research studies that used quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods approaches.\nFind recent literature to summarize, such as that published in the past 10 years. Cite older, valuable\nstudies if they have been widely referenced by others.\nDeficiencies in the Evidence\nAfter advancing the problem and reviewing the literature, the researcher then identifies deficiencies found\nin this literature. The smoking and depression study (Plano Clark et al., 2002) mentions several\ndeficiencies in the literature, including using the high school as a site for study, studying peer groups, and\nthe lack of teacher and administrator role models. These literature gaps or deficiencies led us to call this\ntemplate a deficiencies model. The nature of these deficiencies varies from study to study. Deficiencies\nin past literature may exist because topics with a group, sample, or population remain unexplored, or\nthe research needs to be replicated to see if the same findings hold because of mixed results. Also, in\nqualitative research the literature may not address special populations or group, explore new sites, give\nvoice to underrepresented groups, or include qualitative data such as interviews and observations. In\nquantitative research, the literature may show inadequate theory development, invalidated or unreliable",

        "text": "measures, or inattention to mediating variables. In mixed methods research, the literature may not include\nstudies incorporating quantitative and qualitative data, providing insight from connecting the databases,\nmentioning the integration of them, or drawing inferences from the integration.\nRegardless of the study approach, authors often mention one or several deficiencies. To locate\ndeficiencies, examine future research sections of published studies. They often mention limitations or new\nstudy opportunities, and authors can reference these ideas to justify their proposed study.\nBeyond mentioning the deficiencies, proposal and study writers need to tell how their planned study will\nremedy or address these deficiencies. For example, because past studies overlooked an important\nvariable, a proposed study includes the variable and analyzes its effect. Because past studies have not\naddressed the examination of Native Americans as a cultural group, a study will include them as\nparticipants in the project.\nIn Examples 5.1 and 5.2, the authors point out the gaps or shortcomings of the literature.\nNotice their use of key phrases to indicate the shortcomings: “what remains to be explored” and “little\nempirical research.”\nExample 5.1 Deficiencies in the Literature—Needed Studies\nFor this reason, the meaning of war and peace has been explored extensively by social scientists\n(Cooper, 1965; Alvik, 1968; Rosell, 1968; Svancarova & Svancarova, 1967–68; Haavedsrud,\n1970). What remains to be explored, however, is how veterans of past wars react to vivid scenes\nof a new war. (Ziller, 1990, pp. 85–86)\nExample 5.2 Deficiencies in the Literature—Few Studies\nDespite an increased interest in micropolitics, it is surprising that so little empirical research has\nactually been conducted on the topic, especially from the perspectives of subordinates. Political\nresearch in educational settings is especially scarce: Very few studies have focused on how\nteachers use power to interact strategically with school principals and what this means\ndescriptively and conceptually (Ball, 1987; Hoyle, 1986; Pratt, 1984). (Blase, 1989, p. 381)\nIn summary, when identifying deficiencies in the past literature, proposal and study developers might use\nthe following:\nCite several deficiencies to make a strong case for a new study.\nIdentify specifically the deficiencies of other studies (e.g., methodological flaws, variables\noverlooked).\nWrite about areas overlooked by past studies, including topics, special statistical treatments,\nsignificant implications, and other quantitative deficiencies.\nDiscuss how a proposed study will remedy these deficiencies and provide a unique contribution to\nthe scholarly literature.\nLook at limitations cited in journal articles for clues about deficiencies to cite.\nThese deficiencies might be mentioned using a series of short paragraphs that identify three or four\nshortcomings of the past research or focus on one major shortcoming, as illustrated by Plano Clark et al.\n(2002) in Figure 5.1.",

He identified explicitly\ndecision makers, organizational members, and researchers as the audience for the study:\nA study of an organization’s ownership and its domain, defined here as markets served,\nproduct scope, customer orientation, and technology employed (Abell and Hammond,\n1979; Abell, 1980; Perry and Rainey, 1988), is important for several reasons. First,\nunderstanding relationships among ownership and domain dimensions can help to reveal\nthe underlying logic of organizations’ activities and can help organization members\nevaluate strategies. . . . Second, a fundamental decision confronting all societies\nconcerns the type of institutions to encourage or adopt for the conduct of activity. . . .\nKnowledge of the domain consequences of different ownership types can serve as input\nto that decision. . . . Third, researchers have often studied organizations reflecting one or\ntwo ownership types, but their findings may have been implicitly over generalized to all\norganizations. (Mascarenhas, 1989, p. 582)\nFinally, good introductions to research studies can end with a statement that summarizes the overall\ncontribution of the proposed study. The researcher can succinctly state this contribution in one sentence.\nIn the Plano Clark et al. (2002) study, the authors might have stated that the study provided insight into\nthe potential links between smoking and depression for high school students.\nSummary\nThis chapter provides advice about composing and writing an introduction to a scholarly study.\nFirst, consider how the introduction incorporates the research problems associated with\nquantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods research. Then, use a four-part introduction as a model\nor template. Called the deficiencies model, it first identifies the research problem (including a\nnarrative hook). Then it includes summarizing large categories of the literature that has addressed\nthe problem, followed by indicating one or more deficiencies in the past literature. Finally, it\naddresses specific audiences that will profit from research on the problem, and the introduction\nends with a statement advancing the overall contribution of the study.\nKEY TERMS",

        "text": "SIGNIFICANCE OF A PURPOSE (OR\nSTUDY AIM) STATEMENT\nIn social science research, we typically use the term “purpose” in this\nstatement. In the health sciences, “study aim” is often the preferred\nterm. We will refer to “purpose” in this chapter. Regardless of the\nname, the purpose statement indicates why the researcher conducts\nthe study and what the study intends to accomplish (Locke et al.,\n2014). Unfortunately, proposal-writing texts give little attention to the\npurpose statement, and method writers often incorporate it into\ndiscussions about other topics, such as problem statements or\nresearch questions or hypotheses. Wilkinson (1991), for example,\nrefers to the purpose within the context of the research question and\nobjective. Other authors frame it as an aspect of the research\nproblem (Castetter & Heisler, 1977). However, closely examining their\ndiscussions indicates that they both refer to the purpose statement as\nthe central, organizing idea in a study.\nThis passage is called the purpose statement because it conveys the\noverall intent of a proposed study in a sentence or several sentences.\nIn proposals, researchers need to distinguish clearly among the\npurpose statement, the research problem, and the research\nquestions. In Figure 6.1, the problem represents an issue leading to a\nstudy’s need, such as people refusing to get COVID vaccinations. In\nturn, the study narrows to the purpose or aim of the study. This\npurpose specifies the specific study addressing the problem, such as\nthe need to identify the many factors influencing the refusal to get\nvaccinated. In this example, this purpose models a statement for a\nquantitative project. Then the research questions narrow the study\nfurther by posing one or more questions to be answered. In the\nexample, the overall question in the study is, “Are participants\nrefusing vaccination because they worry about long-term health\nconsequences?” Although many factors may influence a decision to\nget vaccinated, we have chosen concerns about long-term health\nbenefits to address. Finally, the study narrows again to data\ncollection, where we gather information to answer the research\nquestion. In our example, we select the use of a mailed questionnaire\n(or survey) to gather the data. Thus, the purpose statement sets forth\nthe broader intent of the study. It is not the problem or issue or the\nresearch questions in the study (see Chapter 5). Moving through the\nsteps of the problem and on to the data illustrates successive",

A qualitative purpose statement conveys an\nemerging design where the procedures can change during the study\nand uses specific terms drawn from the language of qualitative inquiry\n(Schwandt, 2014). Thus, several basic design features for a purpose\nstatement or study aim for qualitative research follow:\nUse words such as purpose, intent, study aim, or objective to\nintroduce this statement as the central study idea. Set the\nstatement off as a separate sentence or paragraph, and use the\nlanguage of research, such as “The purpose (or intent or\nobjective) of this study is (was) (will be). . . .” Researchers often\nuse the present or past verb tense in journal articles and\ndissertations and the future tense in proposals in planning a\nproject for the future.\nFocus on a single central phenomenon (or concept or idea).\nNarrow the study to one idea to be explored or understood. A\nqualitative purpose statement does not convey relating two or\nmore variables or comparing two or more groups, as in\nquantitative research. Instead, it advances a single phenomenon,\nrecognizing that the study may evolve into exploring relationships\nor comparing groups. This evolution cannot always be\nanticipated at a study’s beginning. A project might begin with the\ncentral phenomenon of exploring teacher identity and the\nmarginalization of this identity in a school (Huber & Whelan,\n1999), the meaning of baseball culture in a study of the work and\ntalk of stadium employees (Trujillo, 1992), or how individuals\ncognitively represent AIDS (Anderson & Spencer, 2002). These\nexamples illustrate a focus on a single idea.\nUse action verbs to convey how learning will take place. Action\nverbs and phrases, such as understand, develop, explore,\nexamine the meaning of, generate, or discover, keep the inquiry\nopen and exploratory.\nUse neutral words and phrases—nondirectional language—such\nas exploring the “self-expression experiences of individuals”\nrather than the “successful self-expression of individuals.” Other\nwords and phrases that may be problematic include useful,\npositive, and informing—all words suggesting a directional",

Constructs is a term\nused for a more abstract, general meaning of a variable. In our\ndiscussion, we will use the term variable to identify an entity that\nvaries and is measurable. Recall from Chapter 3 the types of major\nvariables: independent (or predictor), mediating, moderating,\nconfounding, and dependent (or outcome).\nThe design of a quantitative purpose statement includes the variables\nin the study and their relationships, the participants, and the research\nsite. It also includes language associated with quantitative research\nand the deductive testing of theories. The elements of a quantitative\npurpose statement can include the proposed major variables in a\nstudy (independent, mediating, dependent) and reference a visual\nmodel identifying the order or sequence of the variables.\nQuantitative variables will typically be related, as in a survey, or\ncompared, as in an experiment. Some mention could also occur about\nthe measurement and observation of the variables.\nThe major components of a good quantitative purpose statement\ninclude the following in the order mentioned here:\nInclude words to signal the major intent of the study, such as\npurpose, intent, or objective. Start with “The purpose (or\nobjective or intent) of this study is (was, will be) . . .”\nMention the specific type of quantitative approach (such as\nsurvey or experimental research) used in the study.

At this\npoint, one does not need to describe the theory in detail. In\nChapter 3, we suggested the possibility of writing a separate\n“Theoretical Perspective” section for this purpose. Mentioning it\nin the purpose statement provides emphasis on the importance\nof the theory and foreshadows its use in the study.\nIdentify the variables—independent, dependent, mediating, and\nmoderating variables.\nUse words that connect the variables such as “relationship,”\n“comparison,” “determinants,” “correlation,” or “prediction” to\nindicate the relationship among the variables. Also, a purpose\nstatement could be to “describe” variables. Most quantitative\nstudies employ one or more options for discussing variables in\nthe purpose statement. A combination of comparing and relating\nmight also exist—for example, an experiment in which the\nresearcher has two or more treatment groups and a continuous\nindependent variable.

In a quantitative purpose\nstatement, the researcher states the theory being tested and\nthe variables and their descriptions, relationships, or\ncomparisons. It is important to position the independent\nvariable first and the dependent variable(s) second. Words\nsuch as relationship, correlation, and description are found in\nquantitative purpose statements. The researcher conveys the\nquantitative approach, the participants, and the research site\nfor the investigation. In some purpose statements, the\nresearcher also defines the key variables used in the study. In\na mixed methods study, a purpose statement includes a\nstatement of intent, the type of mixed methods design, the\nforms of qualitative and quantitative data collection and\nanalysis, and the insight to be gained from combining the two\ndatabases.

Quantitative research questions pose questions about the\nrelationships among variables in a study. Quantitative hypotheses,\nin contrast, are predictions the researcher makes about the expected\nrelationships among variables. Testing hypotheses employs statistical\nprocedures in which the investigator draws inferences about a\npopulation from a study sample (see also Chapter 8). Experiments or\nintervention studies, using a comparison among groups, are guided\nby formal hypotheses.\nGuidelines for writing good quantitative research questions and\nhypotheses include the following.\nState variables in research questions or hypotheses.\nQuantitative studies typically use three types. The researcher\nmay compare groups on an independent variable to see its\nimpact on a dependent variable as in an experiment or group\ncomparison. Alternatively, the investigator may relate one or\nmore predictor variables to one or more outcome variables in a\nsurvey project. In each case, the researcher may describe\nresponses to the independent/predictor, mediating, or\ndependent/outcome variables reporting scores with means,\nstandard deviations, and ranges.\nInclude a theory. The most rigorous form of quantitative research\nfollows from a test of a theory (see Chapter 3) and the\nspecification of research questions or hypotheses that logically\nfollow or challenge the theory. The researcher adapts a theory\n(often from the literature) to fit a specific study.\nResearch questions can be descriptive questions where the\nintent is to describe a single variable. Alternatively, the research",

        "text": "questions can state relationship questions among variables.\nCreate a directional alternative hypothesis. In formal\nhypothesis testing language there are two basic forms of\nhypotheses: (a) null and (b) alternative. A null hypothesis\nmakes a prediction that in the general population, no relationship\nor no significant difference exists between groups on a variable.\nThe intent is to disprove a theory by stating a negative\nexpectation. The wording is, “There is no difference (or\nrelationship)” between the groups. Most hypotheses focus on\noffering an alternative hypothesis. An alternative hypothesis\nmakes a prediction about a significant relationship between\nvariables. Moreover, it is important to make this alternative\nhypothesis directional, such that it is a prediction in a certain\ndirection. For example, “it is predicted that there is a positive\nrelationship between height and weight, such that taller people\nare more likely to weigh more” or “the higher the relationship\nskills, the higher the leadership potential.”\nUse directional words of quantitative research, such as affect,\ninfluence, predict, impact, determine, cause, and relate.\nWe provide several scripts for help in writing quantitative research\nquestions and types of hypotheses. Fill in the blanks in these scripts.\nExample 7.1 Script for a Descriptive Quantitative\nResearch Question\nWhat is the frequency and variation of scores on _______\n(name the variable) for _______ (participants) in the study?

A model for this form of writing\nquantitative research can provide a useful template for a\nstudy.\nQUALITATIVE RESEARCH QUESTIONS\nIn a qualitative study, inquirers state research questions, not\nobjectives (i.e., specific goals for the research) or hypotheses (i.e.,\npredictions that involve variables). These research questions assume\ntwo forms: (a) a central question and (b) sub-questions. A central\nquestion in qualitative research is the major open-ended question\nbeing asked about the central phenomenon by interviewing\nparticipants, observing settings, or reviewing documents. Qualitative\nsub-questions narrow the central question by dividing the central\nphenomenon into sub-topics focused on learning more about the\ncentral phenomenon. Our recommendations for writing qualitative\nquestions follow.\nAsk one or two central research questions. The central question\nis a broad question that asks for an exploration of the central\nphenomenon or concept in a study. The inquirer poses this\nquestion, consistent with the emerging methodology of qualitative\nresearch, as a general issue to encourage the views of\nparticipants. To arrive at this question, ask, “What is the\nbroadest question that I can ask in my study?” Beginning\nresearchers trained in quantitative research might struggle with\nthis approach. They are accustomed to reverse thinking.\nQuantitative research comprises narrowing the research\nquestions to a few, specific variables. In qualitative research, the\nintent is to explore the general, complex set of factors\nsurrounding the central phenomenon and present the broad,\nvaried perspectives or meanings that participants hold.\nAsk no more than five to seven sub-questions in addition to\nyour central question(s). Several sub-questions follow the central\nquestion; they narrow the focus of the study but leave open the\nquestioning. This approach is well within the limits set by Miles",

The sub-questions, in turn, become\nspecific questions used in data collection, such as during\ninterviews (or in observing or when looking at documents). In\ndeveloping an interview protocol or guide, the researcher might\nask an icebreaker question at the beginning, for example,\nfollowed by five or so sub-questions in the study (see Chapter\n9). The interview would then end with an additional wrap-up or\nsummary question or by asking, “Who should I turn to, to learn\nmore about this topic?” (Asmussen & Creswell, 1995).\nRelate the central question to the specific qualitative approach.\nFor example, the specificity of the questions in ethnography at\nthis stage of the design differs from that in other qualitative\napproaches. In ethnographic research, Spradley (1980)\nadvanced a taxonomy of ethnographic questions that included a\nmini-tour of the culture-sharing group, their experiences, use of\nnative language, contrasts with other cultural groups, and\nquestions to verify the accuracy of the data. In critical\nethnography, the research questions may build on a body of\nexisting literature. These questions become working guidelines\nrather than proven truths (Thomas, 1993). Alternatively, in\nphenomenology, the questions might be broadly stated without\nspecific reference to the existing literature or a typology of\nquestions. Moustakas (1994) talked about asking what the\nparticipants experienced and what contexts or situations in which\nthey experienced it. A phenomenological example is: “What is it\nlike for a mother to live with a teenage child who is dying of\ncancer?” (Nieswiadomy, 1993, p. 151). In grounded theory, the\nquestions may be directed toward generating a theory of some\nprocess, such as the exploration of “how caregivers and patients\ninteract in a hospital setting.” In a qualitative case study, the\nquestions may address a description of the case and the themes\nthat emerge from studying it.\nBegin the research questions with the words what or how to\nconvey an open and emerging design. The word why often\nimplies that the researcher is trying to explain why something\noccurs, and this suggests to us probable cause-and-effect\nthinking associated with quantitative research and that limits the\nexplanations rather than opening them up for participant views.",

The questioning in a mixed methods study\nwould ideally advance three questions around each of the three\nstrands or components. This configuration is necessary because\nmixed methods does not rely exclusively on either qualitative or\nquantitative research but on both forms of inquiry.\nA mixed methods question is a new type of question not found in\ncurrent research methods books. However, discussion of it exist in\nthe mixed methods literature, and these conversations emerged\nlargely through an editorial published in 2007 (Tashakkori & Creswell,\n2007). The mixed methods question addresses what the\nresearcher hopes to learn with the combination (integration) of the\nquantitative and qualitative data.\nOn writing questions into a mixed methods study, consider the\nfollowing:\nBoth qualitative and quantitative research questions (or\nhypotheses) need to be advanced in a mixed methods study to\nnarrow and focus the purpose statement. Before the two\ndatabases can be integrated or combined, they need to be\nanalyzed separately in response to questions (or hypotheses).\nThese questions or hypotheses can be advanced at the",

Later in the study, when\nthe qualitative phase is addressed, the qualitative research\nquestions appear. When writing these questions or hypotheses,\nfollow the guidelines in this chapter for scripting good quantitative\nquestions or hypotheses and qualitative questions.\nIn addition to quantitative questions or hypotheses and qualitative\nquestions, include a mixed methods research question that\ndirectly addresses what the researcher hopes to learn from\ncombining or integrating the quantitative and qualitative strands\nof the research. Creswell and Plano Clark (2018) have provided\nnumerous examples of mixed methods questions tailored to each\ntype of design. The intent of this question may be difficult for\nwriters to understand, and they may question its value, especially\nif they do not understand connecting or integrating the data.\nTypically, research questions focus on the content of the study’s\nsubject, not on the methods. However, a mixed methods question\nis a methods question, and a question asking about the learning\nfrom integration. Integration is a central component of mixed\nmethods.\nConsider the placement of the questions in a mixed methods\nstudy. In journal articles we see them stated in the concluding\nintroduction section. In a proposal, they may be included in a\nseparate section. Often they will follow immediately the purpose\nof the study or a study aim and serve to narrow the purpose or\naim to be answered in the study.\nSome attention should be given to the order of the research\nquestions and hypotheses. The order will reflect the sequence of\nthe steps in the mixed methods design used (see Chapter 10). In\na single-phase mixed methods project (a convergent design) in\nwhich the quantitative and qualitative results are merged, either\nthe quantitative or the qualitative questions can be posed first. In\na two-phase project (an explanatory sequential design), the first-\nphase quantitative questions or hypotheses would come first,\nfollowed by the second-phase qualitative questions. In a three-\nphase project (an exploratory sequential design), the first-phase\nqualitative component comprises qualitative questions.

Describe the difference between a survey design and an experimental design.\n3. Identify the elements that go into writing a good survey research method plan.\n4. Identify the elements that go into writing a good experimental research method plan.\nINTRODUCTION\nWe turn from the introduction, purpose, and hypotheses to the method section of a proposal. This\nchapter presents essential steps in designing quantitative methods for a research proposal or study, with\nfocus on survey and experimental designs. These designs reflect postpositivist philosophical assumptions,\nas discussed in Chapter 1. For example, determinism suggests that examining the relationships between\nand among variables is central to answering questions and hypotheses through surveys and experiments.\nIn one case, a researcher might evaluate whether playing violent video games is associated with higher\nrates of playground aggression in kids, which is a correlational hypothesis that could be evaluated in a\nsurvey design. In another case, a researcher might be interested in evaluating whether violent video\ngame playing causes aggressive behavior, which is a causal hypothesis best evaluated by a true\nexperiment. In each case, these quantitative approaches focus on carefully measuring (or experimentally\nmanipulating) a small set of variables to answer theory-guided research questions and hypotheses. This\nchapter focuses on the essential components of a method section in proposals for a survey or\nexperimental study.\nPUTTING QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH IN CONTEXT\nPlanning and writing a quantitative method section has a formal structure and intended audience. The\nstructure of the method section has four primary elements: (a) a description of the study population and\nthe sample characteristics (i.e., who are you studying?), (b) a description of the study procedures and\nvariables (i.e., how will you formally test your study hypotheses?), (c) a description of the instruments\nused (i.e., how will you measure your variables?), and (d) a description of the data analytic plan (i.e.,\nhow will you analyze your data?). The intended audience of a quantitative method section is other\nscientists, and the method section should provide sufficient detail that these other scientists could carry\nout the same study in their own research setting. This chapter focuses on approaches for drafting a\nmethod section plan and writeup by describing two popular quantitative designs (survey design and\nexperimental design) and, in each case, the practical decisions around defining the study sample\nparticipants, the variables of interest, study instruments, and intended data analyses. Quantitative\nmethods are a helpful tool for testing formal hypotheses, and the end of each survey and experimental\ndesign section offers some discussion of how to interpret and write up research results.\nQUANTITATIVE DESIGNS\nA survey design provides a quantitative description of trends, attitudes, and opinions of a population, or\ntests for associations among variables of a population, by studying a sample of that population. Survey\ndesigns help researchers answer three types of questions:\n(a) descriptive questions (e.g., What percentage of company employees support hiring women\nof color in executive leadership positions?); (b) questions about the relationships between\nvariables (e.g., is there an association between the number of women of color in executive roles\nand overall perceptions of company satisfaction among employees?); or in cases where a\nsurvey design is repeated over time in a longitudinal study, (c) questions about predictive",

        "text": "relationships between variables over time (e.g., Does Time 1 hiring of new women of color\nexecutives predict greater Time 2 company satisfaction?).\nAn experimental design systematically manipulates one or more variables to evaluate how this\nmanipulation affects an outcome (or outcomes) of interest. Importantly, an experiment isolates the effects\nof this manipulation by holding all other variables constant. When one group receives a treatment and the\nother group does not (which is a manipulated variable of interest), the experimenter can isolate whether\nthe treatment and not other factors influence the outcome. For example, a sample of nurses could be\nrandomly assigned to a 3-week expressive writing program (where they write about their deepest\nthoughts and feelings) or a matched 3-week control writing program (writing about the facts of their daily\nmorning routine). This experiment evaluates whether this expressive writing manipulation reduces job\nburnout in the months following the program (i.e., the writing condition is the manipulated (independent)\nvariable of interest, and job burnout is the (dependent) outcome variable of interest).\nThere are relative advantages and disadvantages in selecting a survey versus experimental design.\nSurveys can be relatively inexpensive and easy to administer in contrast to experimental studies where a\nresearcher aims to systematically manipulate a variable (or variables) while holding all other variables\nconstant. Survey designs offer a tool for describing a study population and testing for associations\nbetween study variables. But experiments can go beyond these survey design features to address causal\nrelationships. In the nurse experiment example here, manipulating expressive writing (and keeping all\nother variables constant) permits inferences around whether writing about one’s deepest thoughts and\nfeelings causes less burnout in the months following the intervention. Whether a quantitative study\nemploys a survey or experimental design, both approaches share a common goal of helping the\nresearcher make inferences about relationships among variables and generalize the sample results to a\nbroader population of interest (e.g., all nurses in the community).\nCOMPONENTS OF A SURVEY STUDY METHOD PLAN\nThe design of a survey method plan follows a standard format. Numerous examples of this format appear\nin scholarly journals, and these examples provide useful models. The following sections detail typical\ncomponents. In preparing to design these components into a proposal, consider the questions on the\nchecklist shown in Table 8.1 as a general guide.\nTable 8.1 A Checklist of Questions for Designing a Survey Study Plan",

Begin the section by describing the rationale for the design. Specifically:\nThe Purpose\nThe primary purpose is to answer a question (or questions) about variables of interest. A sample purpose\nstatement could read: “The primary purpose of this survey study is to empirically evaluate whether the\nnumber of overtime hours worked predicts higher subsequent burnout symptoms in a sample of\nemergency room nurses.”\nRationale for Using the Survey Method\nIndicate why a survey method is the preferred type of approach for this study. In this rationale, it can be\nbeneficial to acknowledge the advantages of survey designs, such as the economy of the design, rapid\nturnaround in data collection, and constraints that preclude you from pursuing other designs (e.g., “An\nexperimental design was not adopted to look at the relationship between overtime hours worked and\nburnout symptoms because it would be prohibitively difficult, and potentially unethical, to randomly assign\nnurses to work different amounts of overtime hours.”).\nType of Survey Method\nIndicate whether the survey will be cross-sectional—with the data collected at one point in time—or\nwhether it will be longitudinal—with data collected over time.\nSpecify the Form of Data Collection\nFowler (2014) identified the following types: mail, telephone, the internet, personal interviews, or group\nadministration (see Fink, 2016; Krueger & Casey, 2014). Using an internet survey and administering it\nonline has been discussed extensively in the literature. (Nesbary, 2000; Sue & Ritter, 2012). There has\nbeen significant growth and popularity of internet survey tools that offer helpful survey building features\nand provide ready access to participant populations across the world (e.g., Amazon’s Mechanical Turk,\nProlific) (Buhrmester et al., 2018). Regardless of the form of data collection, provide a rationale for the\nprocedure, using arguments based on its strengths and weaknesses, costs, data availability, and\nconvenience.\nThe Population and Sample\nSurvey designs often rely on drawing a sample of participants from a broader population. A study\npopulation refers to all people you aim to make inferences about (e.g., all nurses across the world)\nwhereas a study sample refers to the (sub)group of participants examined in the survey study (e.g.,\nnurses drawn from five hospitals in your city). Ideally, sampling of participants is done in such a way as to\nminimize sources of bias and permit inferences about the study population of interest. Methodologists\nhave written excellent discussions about the underlying logic of sampling theory (e.g., Babbie, 2015;\nFowler, 2014). Here are essential aspects of the population and sample to describe in a research plan.",

        "text": "The Population\nIdentify the population in the study. Also state the size of this population, if size can be determined, and\nthe means of identifying individuals in the population. Questions of access arise here, and the researcher\nmight refer to availability of sampling frames—mail or published lists—of potential respondents in the\npopulation. In most cases it is impractical to include all people in a population (e.g., all nurses across the\nworld), and it is important to carefully consider optimal sampling approaches.\nSampling Design\nIdentify whether the sampling design for this population is single stage or multistage (called clustering).\nCluster sampling is ideal when it is impossible or impractical to compile a list of the population’s elements\n(Babbie, 2015). A single-stage sampling procedure is one in which the researcher has access to names\nin the population and can sample the people (or other elements) directly. In a multistage or clustering\nprocedure, the researcher first identifies clusters (groups or organizations), obtains names of individuals\nwithin those clusters, and then samples within them.\nType of Sampling\nIdentify and discuss the selection process for participants in your sample. Ideally aim to draw a random\nsample, in which each individual in the population has an equal probability of being selected (a systematic\nor probabilistic sample). But in many cases it may be difficult (or impossible) to get a random sample of\nparticipants.\nAlternatively, a systematic sample can have precision-equivalent random sampling (Fowler, 2014). In\nthis approach, you choose a random start on a list and select every X-numbered person on the list. The X\nnumber is based on a fraction determined by the number of people on the list and the number selected on\nthe list (e.g., 1 out of every 80 people). Finally, less desirable, but often used, is a nonprobability sample\n(or convenience sample), in which respondents are chosen based on their convenience and availability.\nPopulation Stratification\nIdentify whether the study will involve stratification of the population before selecting the sample. This\nrequires that characteristics of the population members be known so that the population can be stratified\nfirst before selecting the sample (Fowler, 2014). Stratification means that specific characteristics of\nindividuals (e.g., gender—females and males) are represented in the sample and the sample reflects the\ntrue proportion in the population of individuals with certain characteristics. When randomly selecting\npeople from a population, these characteristics may or may not be present in the sample in the same\nproportions as in the population, and stratification ensures their representation. Also identify the\ncharacteristics used in stratifying the population (e.g., gender, income levels, education). Within each\nstratum, identify whether the sample contains individuals with the characteristic in the same proportion as\nit appears in the entire population.\nSample Size Determination\nIndicate the number of people in the sample and the procedures used to compute this number. Sample\nsize determination is at its core a trade-off: A larger sample will provide more precision, but recruiting\nmore participants is time-consuming and costly. In survey research, investigators sometimes choose a\nsample size based on selecting a fraction of the population (say, 10%) or selecting a sample size\ntypically based on past studies. These approaches are not optimal; instead sample size determination\nshould be based on your analysis plans and expected outcomes (Fowler, 2014).\nPower Analysis",

        "text": "If your analysis plan comprises detecting a significant association between variables of interest, a power\nanalysis can help you estimate a target sample size. Many free online and commercially available power\nanalysis calculators are available (e.g., G*Power; Faul et al., 2007; Faul et al., 2009). The input values\nfor a formal power analysis will depend on the questions you aim to address in your survey design study\n(for a helpful resource, see Kraemer & Blasey, 2016). This power analysis for sample size determination\nshould be done during study planning and prior to enrolling any participants. Many scientific journals now\nrequire researchers to report a power analysis for sample size determination in the Method section.\nInstrumentation\nAs part of rigorous data collection, the method proposal also provides detailed information about the\nactual survey instruments to be used in the study. Consider the following:\nThe Survey Instruments Used to Collect Data\nDiscuss whether you used an instrument designed for this research, a modified instrument, or an\ninstrument developed by someone else. For example, if you aim to measure perceptions of stress over\nthe last month, you could use the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen et al., 1983) as the\nstress perceptions instrument in the survey design. Many survey instruments, including the PSS, can be\nacquired and used free for research purposes as long as you cite the original source of the instrument. In\nsome cases, researchers have made the use of their instruments proprietary, requiring a fee for use.\nInstruments are increasingly being delivered through a multitude of online survey products now available\n(e.g., Qualtrics, Survey Monkey). Although these products can be costly, they also can be helpful for\naccelerating and improving the survey research process. For example, researchers can create their\nsurveys quickly using custom templates and post them on websites or e-mail them to participants to\ncomplete. These software programs facilitate data collection into organized spreadsheets for data\nanalysis, reducing data entry errors and accelerating research question and hypothesis testing.\nInstruments and Measures\nInstruments are the devices for collecting measures of variables. Much like a thermometer is an\ninstrument for collecting measures of body temperature, a questionnaire can be an instrument for\ncollecting measures of your target variable of interest (e.g., burnout symptoms). In the social and\nbehavioral sciences, a measure commonly refers to some characteristic of study participants.\nValidity of Scores Using the Instrument\nTo use an existing instrument, describe the established validity of scores obtained from past use of the\ninstrument. This means reporting efforts by authors to establish validity in quantitative research—\nwhether you can draw accurate inferences from scores on the instruments. Although there are many\nforms of validity in survey research, two common forms are (a) construct validity (Does the survey\ninstrument accurately measure the hypothetical construct or concept it was intended to measure?), and\n(b) concurrent or criterion validity (Does the survey instrument associate with other gold-standard\nmeasures of the construct or predict a criterion measure?). Commonly, researchers focus on establishing\nthese forms of validity during initial survey measure development, and they report these findings in the\nfirst scientific reports describing the instruments. Establishing the validity of an instrument helps\nresearchers identify whether an instrument might be a good one to use in survey research. These forms\nof validity (construct, concurrent, criterion) are distinct from identifying the threats to validity in\nexperimental research, as discussed later in this chapter.\nReliability of Scores on the Instrument\nAlso mention whether scores resulting from past use of the instrument demonstrate acceptable\nreliability. Reliability in this context refers to the consistency or repeatability of an instrument. The most\nimportant form of reliability for multi-item instruments is the instrument’s internal consistency—the degree\nto which sets of items on an instrument behave in the same way. This is important because instrument",

        "text": "scale items should be assessing the same underlying construct, so these items should have suitable\nintercorrelations. A scale’s internal consistency is quantified by a Cronbach’s alpha (α) value that ranges\nbetween 0 and 1, with optimal values ranging between .7 and .9. For example, the 10-item PSS has\nexcellent internal consistency across many published reports, with the original source publication\nreporting internal consistency values of α = .84–.86 in three studies (Cohen et al., 1983). It can also be\nhelpful to evaluate a second form of instrument reliability, its test–retest reliability. This form of reliability\nconcerns whether the scale is reasonably stable over time with repeated administrations (e.g., is there a\ncomparable score on the PSS taken by a group of participants at time 1 and then one month later?).\nWhen you modify an instrument or combine instruments in a study, the original validity and reliability may\nnot hold for the new instrument, and it becomes important to establish validity and reliability as a\ncomponent of the data analysis plan.\nInter-Rater Reliability\nAlthough survey designs typically focus on establishing reliability across items within a single instrument\n(internal consistency), some study designs may involve judges or experts who all complete the same\ninstrument. For example, a researcher may be interested in bullying behaviors and ask expert judges to\nmake ratings after viewing a video recording of children interacting on a playground. Inter-rater reliability\nin these studies is an important form of reliability to establish and refers to the degree to which different\nindependent judges agree in their ratings.\nSample Items\nInclude sample items from the instrument so that readers can see the actual items used. In an appendix\nto the proposal, attach sample items or the entire instrument (or instruments) used.\nContent of an Instrument\nIndicate the major content sections in the instrument, such as the cover letter (Dillman, 2007, provides a\nuseful list of items to include in cover letters), the items (e.g., demographics, attitudinal items, behavioral\nitems, factual items), and the closing instructions. Also mention the type of scales used to measure the\nitems on the instrument, such as continuous scales (e.g., strongly agree to strongly disagree) and\ncategorical scales (e.g., yes/no, rank from highest to lowest importance).\nPilot Testing\nDiscuss plans for pilot testing or field-testing the survey, and provide a rationale for these plans. This\ntesting is important for evaluating the appropriateness of the instrument for the study sample, for\nevaluating the internal consistency of items, and to improve or modify questions, format, and instructions.\nPilot testing all study materials also allows assessing how long the study will take (and identify potential\nconcerns with participant fatigue). Indicate the number of people who will test the instrument and the\nplans to incorporate their comments into final instrument revisions.\nAdministering the Survey\nFor a mailed survey, identify steps for administering the survey and for following up to ensure a high\nresponse rate. Salant and Dillman (1994) suggested a four-phase administration process (see Dillman,\n2007, for a similar three-phase process). The first mail-out is a short advance-notice letter to all\nmembers of the sample, and the second mail-out is the actual mail survey, distributed about 1 week after\nthe advance-notice letter. The third mail-out comprises a postcard follow-up sent to all members of the\nsample 4 to 8 days after the initial questionnaire. The fourth mail-out, sent to all nonrespondents,\ncomprises a personalized cover letter with a handwritten signature, the questionnaire, and a\npreaddressed return envelope with postage. Researchers send this fourth mail-out 3 weeks after the\nsecond mail-out. Thus, in total, the researcher concludes the administration period 4 weeks after its start,\nproviding the returns meet project objectives.",

In cases where variables are drawn from previously validated\nsurvey instruments, include a citation for the original source document. Creating this table is especially\nhelpful in survey studies where investigators have many variables of interest.

        "text": "Step 2. Discuss the method by which response bias will be determined. Response bias is the effect of\nnonresponses on survey estimates (Fowler, 2014). Bias means that if nonrespondents had responded,\ntheir responses would have substantially changed the overall results. Mention the procedures used to\ncheck for response bias, such as wave analysis or a respondent/nonrespondent analysis. In wave\nanalysis, the researcher examines returns on select items week by week to determine if average\nresponses change (Leslie, 1972). Based on the assumption that those who return surveys in the final\nweeks of the response period are nearly all nonrespondents, if the responses begin to change, a\npotential exists for response bias. An alternative check for response bias is to contact a few\nnonrespondents by phone and determine if their responses differ substantially from respondents. This\nconstitutes a respondent/nonrespondent check for response bias.\nStep 3. Discuss a plan to provide a descriptive analysis of data for all predictor and outcome variables\nin the study. This analysis should indicate the means, standard deviations, and range of scores for these\nvariables. Identify whether there is missing data (e.g., some participants may not provide responses to\nsome items or whole scales), and develop plans to report how much missing data is present and\nstrategies to replace missing data (for a review, see Schafer & Graham, 2002).\nStep 4. If the proposal contains an instrument with multi-item scales or a plan to develop scales, first\nevaluate whether it will be necessary to reverse-score items and how total scale scores will be\ncalculated. Also mention reliability checks for the internal consistency of the scales (i.e., the Cronbach\nalpha statistic).\nStep 5. Identify the statistics and the statistical computer program for testing the major inferential\nresearch questions or hypotheses in the proposed study. The inferential questions or hypotheses relate\nvariables or compare groups in terms of variables to draw inferences from the sample to a population.\nProvide a rationale for the choice of statistical test, and mention the assumptions associated with the\nstatistic. As shown later in Table 8.3, base this choice on the nature of the research question (e.g.,\nrelating variables or comparing groups as the most popular), the number of predictor and outcome\nvariables, and the variables used as covariates (e.g., see Rudestam & Newton, 2014). Further, consider\nwhether the variables will be measured on an instrument as a continuous score (e.g., age from 18 to 36)\nor as a categorical score (e.g., women = 1, men = 2). Finally, consider whether the scores from the\nsample might be normally distributed in a bell-shaped curve if plotted out on a graph or non-normally\ndistributed. There are additional ways to determine if the scores are normally distributed (see Creswell &\nGuetterman, 2018). These factors, in combination, enable a researcher to determine what statistical test\nwill be suited for answering the research question or hypothesis. In Table 8.3, we show how the factors,\nin combination, lead to the selection of a number of common statistical tests. For additional types of\nstatistical tests, examine statistics methods books, such as Gravetter and Wallnau (2012).\nStep 6. A final step in the data analysis is to present the results in tables or figures and interpret the\nresults from the statistical test.\nPreregistering the Study Plan\nAfter drafting a method plan, it is important to step back and consider whether the goal of your survey\nresearch is exploratory and aimed at generating new hypotheses or whether the goal is confirmatory and\ndirected at formally testing hypotheses. If the research goal is formal hypothesis testing, it is important to\npreregister the plan. Preregistration is the act of publishing your plan and hypotheses in a public registry\nprior to data collection. Preregistration is quickly becoming an essential tool for improving the accuracy\nand transparency of quantitative research (for a review, see Nosek et al., 2018). Two popular public\nregistries for preregistering studies are the Center for Open Science (www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg) or\nthe trials registry maintained by the United States Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health\n(www.clinicaltrials.gov). Each of these registries provides preregistration templates and guidance for\nresearchers and ways to search their databases for studies like your own. Often similar study\npreregistrations on these registries can offer new ideas for improving your own research method plan.\nInterpreting Results and Writing a Discussion Section\nAfter executing a method plan and carrying out the survey study, it is important to interpret the study\nresults and write a discussion section. An interpretation in quantitative research means that the\nresearcher draws conclusions from the results for the research questions, hypotheses, and the larger\nmeaning of the results. This interpretation involves several steps:",

        "text": "Reporting Results\nReport how the results addressed the research question or hypothesis. The Publication Manual of the\nAmerican Psychological Association (American Psychological Association, 2020) suggests that the most\ncomplete meaning of the results come from reporting extensive description, statistical significance\ntesting, confidence intervals, and effect sizes. Thus, it is important to clarify the meaning of these last\nthree reports of the results. Statistical significance testing helps quantify whether a result is due only to\nchance or some factor(s) of interest. The test will provide a p-value, which is the probability of observing\nresults as extreme as those in the study, assuming the results are truly due to chance alone. A p-value of\n.05 or .01 is often considered to be statistically significant. (In common statistical significance testing\nlanguage, a statistical test is significant if the results are unlikely by chance to have occurred and the null\nhypothesis of “no effect” can be rejected. The researcher sets a rejection level such as p = 0.01 and then\nassesses whether the test statistic is statistically significant [less than p = 0.01].) In practice, researchers\nuse statistical significance testing in an affirmative way, describing whether there is a statistically\nsignificant effect or not. For example, a result could be described as “the analysis of variance revealed a\nstatistically significant difference between men, women, and nonbinary participant perceptions of stress\nduring the COVID pandemic F(2, 497) = 8.55, p = 0.001.”\nStatistical Tests in Survey Research\nSurvey designs often use a combination of several popular statistical test statistics to test study\nhypotheses or questions (see Table 8.3). An independent samples t-test compares the means of two\nindependent groups (a paired samples t-test compares two measurements from the same group).\nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA) compares means across two or more groups. Analysis of Covariance\n(ANCOVA) extends ANOVA to include control variables. In cases where the variable of interest is\ncategorical (such as males vs. females vs. nonbinary), the chi-squared test is used. A Pearson Product\nMoment Correlation (or Pearson’s correlation for short) is a measure of the strength of association\nbetween two variables, and multiple regression extends correlation analysis to two or more variables.\nAnytime a test statistic is reported in the method plan or final report, it is italicized (e.g., t, p).\nTable 8.3 Criteria for Choosing Select Statistical Tests\nNumber of\nNumber of Number of\nNature of Control Dis\nIndependent/Predictor Dependent/Outcome Type of Variables\nQuestion Variables of S\nVariables Variables\n(covariates)",

A confidence interval is a range\nof values (an interval) that describes a level of uncertainty around an estimated observed score. A\nconfidence interval shows how good an estimated score might be. A confidence interval of 95%, for\nexample, indicates that if you conducted the same study over and over again, then 95 out of 100 times\nyou ran the study, the confidence interval would include the true population value. An effect size identifies\nthe strength of the conclusions about group differences or the relationships among variables in\nquantitative studies. It is a descriptive statistic that is not dependent on whether the relationship in the\ndata represents the true population. The calculation of effect size varies for different statistical tests: it\ncan be used to explain the variance between two or more variables or the differences among means for\ngroups. It shows the practical significance of the results apart from inferences applied to the population.\nContext of Previous Studies\nThe final step is to draft a discussion section where you restate the main findings and place them in\ncontext of previous published studies. Here it is important to discuss the implications of the results in\nterms of how they are consistent with, refute, or extend previous related studies in the scientific literature.\nHow do your research findings address gaps in our knowledge base on the topic? How do they extend\nprevious theory and research in the area? It is also important to acknowledge the implications of the\nfindings for practice and for future research in the area. It may also involve discussing theoretical and\npractical consequences of the results. It is also helpful to briefly acknowledge potential limitations of the\nstudy and potential alternative explanations for the study findings. The end of the discussion section (i.e.,\nthe last paragraph of the discussion section) then broadens the lens again to remind readers of the main\nfindings and their broader importance to science and society.\nComponents of an Experimental Study Method Plan\nAn experimental method plan follows a standard form: (a) participants and design, (b) procedure, and (c)\nmeasures. These three sequential sections generally are sufficient (often in studies with a few measures,",

Consider the following suggestions when writing the method section plan for an\nexperiment:\nRecruiting Participants\nDescribe the procedures for recruiting participants to be in the study and any selection processes used.\nOften investigators recruit a study sample that shares certain characteristics by formally stating specific\ninclusion and exclusion study criteria when designing their study (e.g., inclusion criteria: participants must\nbe English language speaking and not be children under the age of 18). Recruitment approaches are\nwide-ranging and can include random digit dialing of households in a community, posting study recruitment\nflyers or e-mails to targeted communities, or newspaper advertisements. Describe the recruitment\napproaches that will be used and the compensation to participants for their involvement.\nRandom Assignment\nOne of the principal features distinguishing an experiment from a survey study design is the use of\nrandom assignment. Random assignment is a technique for placing participants into study conditions of a\nmanipulated variable of interest. When individuals are randomly assigned to groups, the procedure is\ncalled a true experiment. If random assignment is used, discuss how and when the study will randomly\nassign individuals to treatment groups. These groups in experiments are levels of an independent\nvariable. This means that of the pool of participants, Individual 1 goes to Group 1, Individual 2 to Group\n2, and so forth so that there is no systematic bias in assigning the individuals. This procedure eliminates\nthe possibility of systematic differences among characteristics of the participants affecting the outcomes.\nThis means that any differences in outcomes can be attributed to the study’s manipulated variable (or\nvariables) of interest (Keppel & Wickens, 2003). Often experimental studies may be interested in\nrandomly assigning participants to levels of a manipulated variable of interest (e.g., a new treatment\napproach for teaching fractions to children vs. the traditional approach). At the same time the study would\nmeasure a second predictor variable of interest that cannot utilize random assignment (e.g., whether the\ntreatment benefits are larger among female compared to male children because it is impossible to",

        "text": "randomly assign children to be male or female). Designs in which a researcher has only partial (or no)\ncontrol over randomly assigning participants to levels of a manipulated variable of interest are called\nquasi-experiments.\nPower Analysis for Sample Size\nConduct and report a power analysis for sample size determination (for a helpful resource, see Kraemer\n& Blasey, 2016). The procedures for a sample size power analysis mimic those for a survey design,\nalthough the focus shifts to estimating the number of participants needed in each condition of the\nexperiment to detect significant group differences. In this case, the input parameters shift to include an\nestimate of the effect size referencing the estimated differences between the groups of your manipulated\nvariable(s) of interest and the number of groups in your experiment.\nFormal Design Statement\nAt the end of the participants section, it is helpful to provide a formal experimental design statement that\nspecifies the independent variables and their corresponding levels. For example, a formal design\nstatement might read, “The experiment consisted of a one-way two-groups design comparing burnout\nsymptoms between full-time and part-time nurses.”\nVariables\nThe variables need to be specified in the formal design statement and described (in detail) in the\nprocedure section of the experimental method plan. Here are some suggestions for developing ideas\nabout variables in a proposal:\nIndependent Variables\nIdentify the independent variables in the experiment (recall the discussion of variables in Chapter 3) and\ntheir manipulation in the study. One approach is to conduct a 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial design in\nwhich two independent variables are manipulated in a single experiment. If this is the case, it is important\nto clarify how and when each independent variable is manipulated.\nManipulation Check\nIf possible, include a manipulation check measure to evaluate whether your study successfully\nmanipulated the independent variable(s) of interest. A manipulation check measure is defined as a\nmeasure of the intended manipulated variable of interest. For example, if a study aims to manipulate self-\nesteem by offering positive test feedback (high self-esteem condition) or negative test feedback (low\nself-esteem condition) using a performance task, quantitatively evaluate whether there are self-esteem\ndifferences between these two conditions with a manipulation check measure. For example, after this\nself-esteem study manipulation, a researcher may include a brief questionnaire measure of state self-\nesteem as a manipulation check measure to evaluate whether the negative test feedback condition\nparticipants indeed have lower state self-esteem relative to the participants in the positive test feedback\ncondition.\nDependent Variables\nIdentify the dependent variable or variables (i.e., the outcomes) in the experiment. The dependent\nvariable is the response or the criterion variable presumed to be caused by or influenced by the\nindependent treatment conditions; as such it is “dependent” on the independent variable manipulation.\nOne consideration in the experimental method plan is whether there are multiple ways to measure\noutcome(s) of interest. For example, if the primary outcome is aggression, it may be possible to collect\nmultiple dependent measures of aggression in the experiment (e.g., a behavioral measure of aggression\nin response to a provocation, self-reported perceptions of aggression).",

        "text": "Other Variables\nIdentify other variables to be measured in the study. Three categories of variables are worth mentioning.\nFirst, include measures of participant demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity). Second,\nmeasure variables that may contribute noise to the study design. For example, self-esteem levels may\nfluctuate during the day (and relate to the study outcome variables of interest), and so it may be\nbeneficial to measure and record time of day in the study (and then use it as a covariate in study\nstatistical analyses). Third, measure variables that may be potential confounding variables. For example,\na critic of the self-esteem manipulation may say that the positive/negative performance feedback study\nmanipulation also unintentionally manipulated rumination, and this rumination better explained study results\non the outcomes of interest. By measuring rumination as a potential confounding variable of interest, the\nresearcher can quantitatively evaluate this claim.\nInstrumentation and Materials\nAs in a survey method plan, a sound experimental study plan calls for a thorough discussion about the\ninstruments used—their development, items, scales, and reports of reliability and validity of scores on\npast uses. However, an experimental study plan also describes in detail the approach for manipulating the\nindependent variables of interest.\nMaterials\nThoroughly discuss the materials used for the manipulated variable(s) of interest. One group, for\nexample, may participate in a special computer-assisted learning plan used by a teacher in a classroom.\nThis plan might involve handouts, lessons, and special written instructions to help students in this\nexperimental group learn how to study a subject using computers. A pilot test of these materials may also\nbe discussed in addition to any training required to administer the materials in a standardized way.\nCover Story\nOften the researcher does not want participants to know what variables are being manipulated or the\ncondition they have been assigned to (and sometimes what the primary outcome measures of interest\nare). It is important, then, to draft a cover story to explain the study and procedures to participants\nduring the experiment. A cover story is a plausible (but potentially untrue) explanation to research\nparticipants about the purpose of the study and study procedures. If any deception is used in the study, it\nis important to draft a suitable debriefing approach. With any study plan, it is important to have all\nprocedures and materials approved by your sponsoring institution’s IRB (see Chapter 4).\nExperimental Procedures\nThe specific experimental design procedures need to be identified. This description involves indicating the\noverall experimental design, citing reasons for using the design to test study hypotheses, and a step-by-\nstep chronological description of the study procedures. Often a visual figure of the study procedures can\nbe helpful.\nType of Experiment\nIdentify the type of experimental design to be used in the proposed study. The types available in\nexperiments are pre-experimental designs, quasi-experiments, and true experiments. With pre-\nexperimental designs, the researcher studies a single group and implements an intervention during the\nexperiment. This design does not have a control group to compare with the experimental group. In quasi-\nexperiments, the investigator uses control and experimental groups, but the design may have partial or\ntotal lack of random assignment to groups. In a true experiment, the investigator randomly assigns the\nparticipants to treatment groups.",

In many experiments, those of a type called\nbetween-subject designs, every participant experiences only one condition on a manipulated variable\nof interest (Keppel & Wickens, 2003; Rosenthal & Rosnow, 1991). One-way designs comprise only\none manipulated independent variable. By contrast, a factorial design manipulates two or more\nindependent variables to examine the independent and interactive effects of these treatment\nvariables on an outcome.\nIn contrast to between-subject designs, participants in within-subject designs experience multiple (or\nall) conditions of a manipulated variable of interest. For example, a researcher may elect to employ\nthe same pre- and post-treatment measure (often called a repeated measures design), making\n“time” (pre- and post-intervention) a within-subjects variable.\nIt is often the case that studies employ both a between subjects variable and a within-subjects\nindependent variable in the same study and are called mixed designs. For a study testing working\nconditions among nurses and burnout symptoms, one could randomly assign a sample of nurses to\neither work part time or full time for a period of time (a between-subjects variable) and measure their\nburnout symptoms before and after this work manipulation (measuring burnout at two time points\ncreates a “time” within-subjects variable), making this study design a mixed design.\nProvide a diagram or a figure to illustrate the specific research design to be used. A standard\nnotation system needs to be used in this figure. As a research tip, we recommend using the classic\nnotation system provided by Campbell and Stanley (1963, p. 6):\nX represents an exposure of a group to an experimental variable or event, the effects of which\nare to be measured.\nO represents an observation or measurement recorded on an instrument.\nXs and Os in a given row are applied to the same specific persons.\nXs and Os in the same column, or placed vertically relative to each other, are simultaneous.\nThe left-to-right dimension indicates the temporal order of procedures in the experiment\n(sometimes indicated with an arrow).\nThe symbol R indicates random assignment.\nSeparation of parallel rows by a horizontal line indicates that comparison. Groups are not equal\n(or equated) by random assignment. No horizontal line between the groups displays random\nassignment of individuals to treatment groups.\nIn Examples 8.1–8.4, this notation is used to illustrate pre-experimental, quasi-experimental, true\nexperimental, and single-subject designs.\nExample 8.1 Pre-Experimental Designs\nOne-Shot Case Study.

        "text": "Discuss how you plan to address the threat in the design of your experiment.\nThe Procedure\nA researcher needs to describe in detail the sequential step-by-step procedure for conducting the\nexperiment. A reader should be able to clearly understand the cover story explaining the study to\nparticipants, the design being used, the manipulated variable(s) and outcome variable(s), and the\nchronological sequence of study activities. It is also important to describe steps taken to minimize noise\nand bias in the experimental procedures. For example, if the experimenter is aware of whether a\nparticipant receives the treatment condition that will be most helpful, the experimenter might act in more\npositive and reinforcing ways in administering the outcome measure. To reduce this form of\nexperimenter bias, it is helpful to make the experimenter administering the outcome measure blind to the\nparticipant’s study condition. Blinding in experimental research is when the experimenter (and/or the\nparticipant) is kept unaware of the participant’s assigned study condition. Thus, experimenter blinding is a\nstep a researcher could take to minimize bias and to describe in the experimental procedures (e.g., “To\nreduce the risk of experimenter bias, the experimenter was blind to the participant’s study condition until\nall outcome measures were assessed.”).\nDiscuss a step-by-step approach for the procedure in the experiment. For example, Borg and Gall (2006)\noutlined steps typically used in the procedure for a pretest–posttest control group design with matching\nparticipants in the experimental and control groups.\n1. Administer measures of the dependent variable or a variable closely correlated with the dependent\nvariable to the research participants.\n2. Assign participants to matched pairs on the basis of their scores on the measures described in Step\n1.\n3. Randomly assign one member of each pair to the experimental group and the other member to the\ncontrol group. Expose the experimental group to the experimental treatment, and administer no\ntreatment or an alternative treatment to the control group.\n4. Administer measures of the dependent variables to the experimental and control groups.\n5. Compare the performance of the experimental and control groups on the posttest(s) using tests of\nstatistical significance.\nData Analysis\nAssigning participants to study conditions in experimental studies means that study analyses are\nstraightforward—the principle analyses test hypotheses that focus on comparing groups across these\nstudy conditions. There are a series of steps to describe in the study data analytic plan:\nReporting the Descriptive Statistics\nSome descriptive statistics commonly reported include frequencies (e.g., how many male and female\nparticipants were in the study?), means and standard deviations (e.g., what’s the mean age of the\nsample; what is the ethnic composition of the sample; what are the group means and corresponding\nstandard deviation values for the primary outcome measures?).\nPreliminary Analysis\nReport any preliminary analyses to be conducted prior to testing the study hypotheses. Some of these\ninclude statistical tests evaluating (a) the success of randomization (i.e., was randomization successful in\ncreating equivalent groups across study conditions?); (b) whether the study independent variable(s)\nmanipulation(s) were successful (i.e., are there group differences on the manipulation check measure[s]);\nand (c) whether there are associations (correlations) between key study variables (e.g., such as two\ndependent variables collected in the study)?\nInferential Statistical Tests",

        "text": "Indicate the inferential statistical tests used to examine the hypotheses in the study. The same statistical\ntests described for survey analyses are also used in experimental designs (see Table 8.3). However,\nbecause a high priority is placed on comparing groups in experiments, there is heavy reliance on ANOVA,\nANCOVA, and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) data analyses.\nFactorial Designs\nIn factorial designs where more than one independent variable is manipulated, you can test for main\neffects (of each independent variable) and interactions between independent variables. Also, like survey\nmethod designs, indicate the practical significance by reporting effect sizes and confidence intervals.\nSingle-Subject Designs\nFor single-subject research designs, use line graphs for baseline and treatment observations for abscissa\n(horizontal axis) units of time and the ordinate (vertical axis) target behavior. Researchers plot each data\npoint separately on the graph and connect the data points with lines (e.g., see Neuman & McCormick,\n1995).\nOccasionally, tests of statistical significance, such as t tests, are used to compare the pooled mean of\nthe baseline and the treatment phases, although such procedures may violate the assumption of\nindependent measures (Borg & Gall, 2006).\nPreregistering the Study Plan\nTrue experiments offer a way to test causal relations among independent and dependent variables\nspecified by formal hypotheses. Thus, preregistering the experimental study hypotheses and plan in a\npublic registry is important. Preregistration follows the same guidelines as those described for\npreregistering a survey method plan discussed earlier in this chapter.\nInterpreting Results and Writing a Discussion Section\nAfter data collection is complete, the final step in an experiment is to interpret the findings in light of the\nhypotheses or research questions and to draft a results and discussion section. The results section\nfollows the steps described in data analysis. In the discussion section writeup, address whether the\nhypotheses were supported or whether they were refuted. Describe whether the independent variable\nmanipulation was effective (a manipulation check measure can be helpful in this regard). Suggest why the\nresults were significant, or why they were not, linking the new evidence with past literature (see Chapter\n2), the theory used in the study (see Chapter 3), or persuasive logic that might explain the results.\nAddress whether the results might have been influenced by unique strengths of the approach, or\nweaknesses (e.g., threats to internal validity) or study limitations, and indicate how the results might be\ngeneralized to certain people, settings, and times. Finally, indicate the implications of the results for\nscience and society, including implications for future research on the topic.\nExample 8.5 is a description of an experimental method plan adapted from a value affirmation stress\nstudy published by Creswell and colleagues (Creswell et al., 2005).\nExample 8.5 An Experimental Method Plan\nThis study tested the hypothesis that thinking about one’s important personal values in a self-\naffirmation activity could buffer subsequent stress responses to a laboratory stress challenge\ntask. The specific study hypothesis was that the self-affirmation group, relative to the control\ngroup, would have lower salivary cortisol stress hormone responses to a stressful performance\ntask. Here we highlight a plan for organizing the methodological approach for conducting this\nstudy.

        "text": "Method\nParticipants\nA convenience sample of 85 undergraduates will be recruited from a large public university on the\nWest Coast and compensated with course credit or $30. This sample size is justified based on a\npower analysis conducted prior to data collection with the software program G*Power (Faul et al.,\n2007; Faul et al., 2009) based on specific input parameters for power analysis. Participants will\nbe eligible to participate if they meet the following study criteria (list study inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria here). All study procedures have been approved by the University of California, Los\nAngeles Institutional Review Board, and participants will provide written informed consent prior to\nparticipating in study related activities.\nThe study is a 2 × 4 mixed design, with value affirmation condition as a two-level between-\nsubjects variable (condition: value affirmation or control) and time as a four-level within-subjects\nvariable (time: baseline, 20 minutes post-stress, 30 minutes post-stress, and 45 minutes post-\nstress). The primary outcome measure is the stress hormone cortisol, as measured by saliva\nsamples.\nProcedure\nTo control for the circadian rhythm of cortisol, all laboratory sessions will be scheduled between\nthe hours of 2:30 pm and 7:30 pm. Participants will be run through the laboratory procedures one\nat a time. The cover story comprises telling participants that the study is interested in studying\nphysiological responses to laboratory performance tasks.\nUpon arrival all participants will complete an initial values questionnaire where they will rank order\nfive personal values. After a 10-minute acclimation period, participants will provide a baseline\nsaliva sample for the assessment of salivary cortisol levels. Participants will then receive\ninstructions on the study tasks and then will be randomly assigned by the experimenter (using a\nrandom number generator) to either a value affirmation or control condition, where they will be\nasked to (description of the value affirmation independent variable manipulation here along with\nthe subsequent manipulation check measure). All participants will then complete the laboratory\nstress challenge task (description of the stress challenge task procedures for producing a stress\nresponse here). After the stress task, participants will complete multiple post-stress task\nquestionnaire measures (describe them here), and then provide saliva samples at 20, 30, and 45\nminutes post-stress task onset. After providing the last saliva sample, participants will be\ndebriefed, compensated, and dismissed.\nSummary\nThis chapter identified essential components for organizing a methodological approach and plan\nfor conducting either a survey or an experimental study. The outline of steps for a survey study\nbegan with a discussion about the purpose, the identification of the population and sample, the\nsurvey instruments to be used, the relationship between the variables, the research questions,\nspecific items on the survey, the steps to be taken in the analysis, and the interpretation of the\ndata from the survey. In the design of an experiment, the researcher identifies participants in the\nstudy, the variables—the manipulated variable(s) of interest and the outcome variables—and the\ninstruments used. The design also includes the specific type of experiment, such as a pre-\nexperimental, quasi-experimental, true experiment, or single-subject design. Then the researcher\ndraws a figure to illustrate the design, using appropriate notation. This is followed by comments\nabout potential threats to internal and external validity (and possibly statistical and construct\nvalidity) that relate to the experiment, the statistical analyses used to test the hypotheses or\nresearch questions, and the interpretation of the results.",

Although the processes are similar, qualitative methods rely on text and image data, have\nunique steps in data analysis, and draw on diverse procedures. Writing a method section for a proposal\nor study for qualitative research partly requires presenting a rationale for its use. Because many\napproaches exist for the design of procedures in qualitative research, include information about the type\nof design. Specify the types of qualitative data you plan to collect and how you will record the data on\nprotocols or guides. Go through the steps in data analysis that span from looking over the data to\ngenerating themes and a story line. Use multiple strategies to validate your project’s findings, and write\nyour study creatively.\nThis chapter addresses these important components of writing a good qualitative method section into a\nproposal or study.

These discussions are less frequently found today in the\nliterature and what constitutes qualitative inquiry. Reasons for using qualitative research need to be\nprovided in a project. Readers of a qualitative proposal or project often need to be oriented to the basic\nfeatures of qualitative research.\nReview the needs of potential audiences for the proposal or study. Decide whether audience members\nare knowledgeable enough about the characteristics of qualitative research that this section is not\nnecessary. For example, although qualitative research is typically accepted and well-known in the social\nsciences, it has emerged in the health sciences only in the last couple of decades. Thus, a review of the\nbasic characteristics will be important for health science audiences. If there is some question about the\naudience’s knowledge, present the basic characteristics of qualitative research, and consider discussing\na recent qualitative research journal article (or study) to use as an example to illustrate the\ncharacteristics.\nA project might convey the basic characteristics of qualitative research such as those found in current\nwritings (Creswell & Poth, 2018; Marshall & Rossman, 2022). A review of these is as follows.\nParticipants’ Meanings\nIn the entire qualitative research process, the researchers focus on learning the meaning that the\nparticipants hold about the problem or issue, not the meaning that the researchers bring to the research\nor that writers express in the literature.\nNatural Setting\nQualitative researchers tend to collect data in the field at the site where participants experience the issue\nor problem under study. Researchers do not bring individuals into a lab (a contrived situation), nor do they\ntypically send out instruments for individuals to complete. This up-close information gathered by talking\ndirectly to people and seeing them behave and act within their context is a major characteristic of\nqualitative research. In the natural setting, the researchers have face-to-face interaction, often extending\nover a prolonged period.\nResearcher as Key Instrument\nQualitative researchers collect data themselves through examining documents, observing behavior, or\ninterviewing participants. They may use a protocol—an instrument for recording data—but the",

        "text": "researchers are the ones who gather the information and interpret it. They do not tend to use or rely on\nquestionnaires or instruments developed by other researchers.\nMultiple Sources of Data\nQualitative researchers typically gather multiple forms of data, such as interviews, observations,\ndocuments, and audiovisual or social media information rather than rely on a single data source. Then the\nresearchers review all the data, make sense of it, and organize it into codes and themes that cut across\nall data sources. These are all open-ended forms of data in which the participants share their ideas\nfreely, not constrained by predetermined scales or instruments.\nInductive and Deductive Data Analysis\nQualitative researchers typically work inductively, building patterns, categories, and themes from the\nbottom up by organizing the data into increasingly more abstract units of information. This inductive\nprocess illustrates working back and forth between the themes and the database until the researchers\nhave established a comprehensive set of themes. Then deductively, the researchers look back at their\ndata from the themes to determine if more evidence can support each theme or whether they need to\ngather additional information. Thus, although the process begins inductively, deductive thinking also plays\nan important role as the analysis moves forward.\nEmergent Design\nThe research process for qualitative researcher is emergent. This means that the initial plan will evolve\nduring the research. Some or all phases of the process may change or shift after the researcher enters\nthe field and begins to collect data. For example, the questions may change, data collection forms may\nshift, and the individuals studied and the sites visited may be modified. These shifts signal that the\nresearchers are delving deeper into the topic of the phenomenon under study. The key idea behind\nqualitative research is to learn about the problem or issue from participants and to address the research\nto obtain that information.\nReflexivity\nIn qualitative research, inquirers reflect about how their role in the study and their background, culture,\nand experiences hold potential for shaping their interpretations, such as the themes they advance and the\nmeanings they ascribe to the data. Researchers explicitly identify reflexively the biases, values, and\npersonal background, such as gender, history, culture, and socioeconomic status (SES) that shape\ninterpretations formed during a study. This aspect of the methods is more than merely advancing biases\nand values in the study but how the researchers’ background may shape the study’s direction.\nReflexivity requires commenting on two important aspects: (a) include statements about past\nexperiences with the research problem or with the participants or setting that help the reader understand\nthe connection between the researchers and the study—these experiences may involve participation in\nthe setting, past educational or work experiences, culture, ethnicity, race, SES, or other demographics\nthat directly tie the researchers to the study—and (b) be explicit about how these experiences may\npotentially shape the interpretations the researchers make during the study. For example, the\nexperiences may cause researchers to lean toward certain themes, actively look for evidence to support\ntheir positions, and create favorable or unfavorable conclusions about the sites or participants. Inquirers\nincorporate reflexivity into a discussion of the methods. The comments can build on memos. Memos are\nwritten notes taken by the researcher during the research process that reflect on the development of\ncodes and themes. In mentioning personal experiences, researchers need to limit their discussions about\npersonal experiences so that they do not override the importance of the content or methods in a study.\nResearcher’s Role\nAnother aspect of reflection involves creating statements about the researcher’s role. These statements\nmention connections between the researcher and the participants or the research sites that may unduly\ninfluence the researcher’s interpretations. “Backyard” research (Glesne & Peshkin, 1992) involves\nstudying the researcher’s organization, or friends, or immediate work setting. This often leads to",

When researchers collect data at their own workplaces\n(or when they are in a superior role to participants), the information may be convenient and easy to\ngather. Still, it may not be accurate information, and it may jeopardize the roles of the researchers and\nthe participants. If studying the “backyard” is essential, the researcher is responsible for showing how the\ndata will not be compromised and how such information will not place the participants (or the\nresearchers) at risk. In addition, multiple strategies for validation (see validation later in this chapter) are\nnecessary to demonstrate the accuracy of the information.\nA Complex Account\nQualitative researchers try to develop a complex picture of the problem or issue under study. This\ninvolves reporting multiple perspectives, identifying the many factors involved in a situation, and generally\nsketching the larger picture. This larger picture is not necessarily a linear model of cause and effect but\nrather a model of multiple factors interacting differently. Qualitative researchers would say this picture\nmirrors real life and how events operate in the real world. A visual model of many facets of a process\naids in establishing this complex picture (see, e.g., Creswell & Brown, 1992).\nTHE APPROACH OR DESIGN\nWhat design, approach, or set of procedures will be used in a study? We begin by mentioning the basic\nor foundational procedures typically used in qualitative research and then highlighting the analytic\nframework-oriented procedures that researchers may add (see Figure 9.1 for the distinctions between\ndescriptive methods and an analytic framework).\nDescription\nFigure 9.1 Foundational Methods and Methods Drawn From Traditions\nSources: Braun & Clarke, 2005; Sandelowski, 2000, 2010.\nDescriptive Methods\nOne approach to the procedures comprises coding the data and developing themes. Reporting themes,\nor conducting a “theme analysis” (Levitt et al., 2018, p. 28) has found its way into qualitative research as\na distinct method approach. It has been called the “foundational method” of analysis, a “thematic\nanalysis,” or a “descriptive analysis” (Braun & Clark, 2006; Sandelowski, 2000, 2010). We call this\nmethod “descriptive methods” and presented it as one qualitative design earlier in Table 1.3. A descriptive\nmethod in qualitative research is an approach to analysis where the researcher stays close to the data,\nuses limited frameworks and interpretation for explaining the data, and catalogues the information into",

        "text": "themes. The recent American Psychological Association standards identified it as a distinct type of\nqualitative methods approach (Levitt et al., 2018). Figure 9.1 presents the major dimensions of\ndescriptive methods. It also suggests that these methods are foundational to more analytic frameworks,\nwhich is not to suggest that it has less value and credibility than using a framework to report the codes\nand themes.\nAnalytic Frameworks\nIn addition to descriptive methods, researchers may choose to use a larger interpretative framework in\ntheir analysis. An analytic framework in qualitative designs means that the procedures used in\ninterpreting data fit into a predetermined structure identified in the literature. For example, narrative\nresearch employs re-storying the participants’ stories using structural devices, such as plot, setting,\nactivities, climax, and denouement (Clandinin & Connelly, 2000). Phenomenological research analyzes\nsignificant statements, the generation of meaning units, and the development of what Moustakas (1994)\ncalled an “essence” description. Grounded theory has systematic steps (Corbin & Strauss, 2015; Strauss\n& Corbin, 1990, 1998). These involve generating categories of information (open coding), selecting one of\nthe categories and positioning it within a theoretical model (axial coding), and then advancing a story from\nthe interconnection of these categories (selective coding). Case studies and ethnographic research\ninvolve a detailed description of the setting or individuals, followed by data analysis for themes or issues\n(see Stake, 1995; Wolcott, 1994).\nAn analytic framework means going beyond the everyday language of participants and using an “analytic\ntradition” (Braun & Clark, 2006, p. 78). These frameworks may be considered an approach or a distinct\nqualitative design, as suggested by Creswell and Poth (2018) and enumerated by multiple authors in\nbooks and articles across the social and health sciences. Many approaches exist, such as the 28\nidentified by Tesch (1990), the 22 types in Wolcott (2008), and the five approaches to qualitative inquiry\nby Creswell and Poth (2018). Marshall and Rossman (2022) discussed five types common across five\ndifferent authors. In Chapter 1 we identified several of these qualitative designs that researchers use:\nnarrative research, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case studies. We selected these\nfive because they are popular across the social and health sciences today. Others exist that have been\naddressed adequately in qualitative books, such as participatory action research (Kemmis & Wilkinson,\n1998), discourse analysis (Cheek, 2004), or action research (Ivankova, 2015).\nA detailed discussion of these frameworks for researchers is beyond the scope of this book and requires\nthat researchers read and develop an in-depth understanding of the analytic framework of choice. These\nframeworks have their way of stating research questions, data collection procedures, data analysis\nsteps, and outcomes for the project.\nIn writing about the design or approach for a qualitative proposal, consider the following research\nsuggestions:\nIdentify the specific approach you will be using and provide references to the literature discussing the\napproach.\nProvide some background information about the approach, such as its discipline origin, its\napplications (preferably to your field), and a brief definition (see Chapter 1 for the six approaches or\ndesigns).\nDiscuss why it is an appropriate strategy to use in the proposed study.\nIdentify how the use of the approach will shape many aspects of the design process, such as the\ntitle, the problem, the research questions, the data collection and analysis, and the report write-up.\nDATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES\nThe data collection procedures include setting the boundaries for the study through sampling and\nrecruitment, gaining permissions, collecting information through multiple forms of data (e.g., observations,\ninterviews, documents, and visual and social media), and developing protocols or guides for collecting the\ndata.",

        "text": "Sampling and Recruitment\nIdentify the purposefully selected sites or individuals for the proposed study. Qualitative research aims to\npurposefully sample to select participants or sites (or documents or visual material) that will best help\nthe researcher understand the problem and the research question. This does not necessarily suggest\nrandom sampling or selection of many participants and sites, as is typically found in quantitative research.\nA discussion of participants and the site might include four aspects identified by Miles and Huberman\n(1994): (a) the setting (i.e., where the research will take place), (b) the actors (i.e., who will be observed\nor interviewed), (c) the events (i.e., what the actors will be observed or interviewed doing), and (d) the\nprocess (i.e., the evolving nature of events undertaken by the actors within the setting).\nDiscuss the strategies used to recruit individuals (or cases) to the study. This is a challenging aspect of\nresearch. Indicate ways of informing appropriate participants about the study, and cite the actual\nrecruitment messages sent to them. Discuss ways to provide incentives for individuals to participate, and\nreflect on approaches that will be used if one method of recruitment is not successful.\nComment on the number of participants and sites involved in the research. Aside from the small number\nthat characterizes qualitative research, how many sites and participants should you have? First, there is\nno specific answer to this question; the literature contains a variety of perspectives (e.g., see Creswell &\nPoth, 2018). From a review of many qualitative research studies, we have some rough estimates to\nadvance. Sample size depends on the qualitative design being used (e.g., ethnography, case study).\nNarrative includes one or two individuals; phenomenology involves a range of 3–10; grounded theory, 20–\n30; ethnography examines one single culture-sharing group with numerous artifacts, interviews, and\nobservations; and case studies include about four to five cases. We also suggest that the descriptive\nmethod might include at least 20 participants. An estimated sample size is certainly one approach to the\nsample size issue. Another approach is equally viable. The idea of saturation comes from grounded\ntheory. Charmaz (2006) said that one stops collecting data when the categories (or themes) are\nsaturated, that is, when gathering fresh data no longer sparks new insights or reveals new themes. This\nis when you have an adequate sample.\nPermissions\nIndicate steps taken to obtain permission from the IRB (see Chapter 4) to protect the rights of human\nparticipants. Attach, as an appendix, the approval letter from the IRB, and discuss the process involved in\nsecuring permissions. Discuss steps taken to gain entry to the setting and to secure permissions to study\nthe participants or situation (Marshall & Rossman, 2022). It is important to gain access to research or\narchival sites by seeking the approval of gatekeepers, that is, individuals at the site who provide access\nto the site and allow or permit the research to be done. A brief proposal might need to be developed and\nsubmitted for review to gatekeepers. Bogdan and Biklen (1992) advanced topics that could be addressed\nin such a proposal:\nWhy was the site chosen for study?\nWhat activities will occur at the site during the research study?\nWill the study be disruptive?\nHow will the results be reported?\nWhat will the gatekeeper gain from the study?\nData Collection Types\nIn many qualitative studies, inquirers collect multiple forms of data and spend a considerable time in the\nnatural setting gathering information. Indicate the type or types of data to be collected. The four major\ntypes are as follows.\nA qualitative observation is when the researcher takes field notes on the behavior and activities of\nindividuals at the research site. In these field notes, the researcher records activities at the site in an\nunstructured or semi-structured way (using some prior questions that the inquirer wants to know).",

        "text": "Qualitative observers may also engage in roles varying from a nonparticipant to a complete participant.\nTypically, these observations are open-ended in that the researchers ask general questions of the\nparticipants, allowing the participants to provide their views freely.\nIn qualitative interviews, the researcher conducts face-to-face interviews or telephone interviews with\nparticipants or engages in focus group interviews with six to eight interviewees in each group. These\ninterviews involve unstructured and generally a few open-ended questions and are intended to elicit views\nand opinions from the participants.\nDuring the process of research, the investigator may collect qualitative documents. These may be\npublic documents (e.g., newspapers, minutes of meetings, official reports) or private documents (e.g.,\npersonal journals and diaries, letters, e-mails).\nA final category of qualitative data comprises qualitative audiovisual, social media, and digital\nmaterials. This data may take the form of photographs, art objects, videotapes, website main pages, e-\nmails, text messages, social media text, or forms of sound. Include creative data collection procedures\nthat fall under visual ethnography (Pink, 2001) and living stories, metaphorical visual narratives, and digital\narchives (Clandinin, 2007).\nIn a discussion about data collection forms, be specific about the types, and include arguments\nconcerning the strengths and weaknesses of each type, as discussed in Table 9.2. Typically, in good\nqualitative research the researchers draw on multiple sources of qualitative data to make interpretations\nabout a research problem.\nTable 9.2 Qualitative Data Collection Types, Options, Strengths, and Limitations",

Also written on this form might be demographic information about the time,\nplace, and date of the field setting where the observations take place.\nInterview Protocol\nPlan to develop and use an interview protocol for asking questions and recording answers during a\nqualitative interview. Researchers record information from interviews by making handwritten notes,\naudiotaping, or videotaping. Even if an interview is taped, we recommend that researchers take notes if\nrecording equipment fails. If audiotaping is used, researchers need to plan for the transcription of the\ntape. Information needs to be recorded about the time and date of the interview, where the interview took\nplace, and the interviewer and interviewee’s names.\nThe interview protocol should be about one to two pages in length. It should be prepared in advance of\nthe interview and used consistently in all the interviews. There should be some spaces between the\nquestions for the interviewer to write short notes and quotes if the audio-recording device does not work.\nAlthough no precise number can be given, the total number of questions should be somewhere between\nfive and 10. It is helpful for the interviewer to memorize the questions so that the researcher does not\nappear to be simply reading the interview protocol. The interview protocol comprises several important\ncomponents, including basic information about the interview, an introduction, the interview content\nquestions with probes, and closing instructions (see also Creswell & Bàez, 2020). An example of a\ncomplete interview protocol is shown in Figure 9.2.\nThe protocol provides the instructions to the interviewer so that useful information is not overlooked\nduring a potentially anxious period of conducting the interview.\nIn the introduction section, the interviewer needs to introduce themselves and discuss the purpose of the\nstudy. This purpose can be written out in advance and simply read by the interviewer. It should also\ncontain a prompt to the interviewer to collect a signed copy of the informed consent form (alternatively,\nthe participant may have already sent the form to the interviewer). The interviewer might also talk about\nthe general structure of the interview (e.g., how it will begin, the number of questions, the time it should\ntake) and ask the interviewee if they have any questions before beginning the interview. Finally, before\nthe interview begins, the interviewer may need to define some important terms used in the interview.",

Assure the interviewee of the confidentiality of the interview. Ask if you can follow up with\nanother interview if one is needed to clarify certain points. One question that may surface is how\nparticipants will learn about the results of your project. It is important to think through and provide a\nresponse to this question because it involves your time and resources. A convenient way to provide\ninformation to interviewees is to offer to send them an abstract of the final study. This brief\ncommunication of results is efficient and convenient for most researchers.\nDATA ANALYSIS PROCEDURES\nA methods discussion in a qualitative proposal or study needs also to specify the steps in analyzing the\nforms of qualitative data. The intent is to make sense out of text and image data. It involves segmenting\nand taking apart the data (like peeling back the layers of an onion) and putting it back together. The\ndiscussion in your study about qualitative data analysis might begin with several general points about the\noverall process:\nSimultaneous Procedures\nData analysis in qualitative research will proceed hand in hand with other parts of developing the\nqualitative study, namely, the data collection and the write-up of findings. While interviews are going on,\nresearchers may be analyzing an interview collected earlier, writing memos that may ultimately be\nincluded as a narrative in the final report, and organizing the structure of the study. This process is unlike\nquantitative research in which the investigator collects the data, then analyzes the information, and finally\nwrites the report.\nWinnowing the Data\nBecause text and image data are so dense and rich, all of the information cannot be used in a qualitative\nstudy. Thus, in the analysis of the data, researchers need to “winnow” the data (Guest et al., 2012),\nfocusing on some of the data and disregarding other parts of it. This process, too, is different from\nquantitative research in which researchers go to great lengths to preserve all the data and reconstruct or\nreplace missing data. In qualitative research, the impact of this process is to aggregate data into a small\nnumber of themes, something between five and seven themes (Creswell & Poth, 2018).\nUsing Qualitative Computer Software Programs\nAlso specify whether you will use a qualitative computer data analysis program to assist you in analyzing\nthe data (or whether you will hand code the data). Hand coding is a laborious and time-consuming\nprocess, even for data from a few individuals. Thus, qualitative software programs have become popular.\nThey help researchers organize, sort, and search for information in text or image databases (see the\nGuest et al., 2012, chapter on qualitative data analysis software). Several excellent qualitative\ncomputer software programs are available, and they have similar features with good tutorials and\ndemonstration files. In qualitative data analysis, they can incorporate both text and image (e.g.,\nphotographs) data, store and organize data, search text associated with specific codes, interrelate codes\nfor making queries of the relationship among codes, and import and export of qualitative data to\nquantitative programs, such as spreadsheets or statistical programs. The basic idea behind these\nprograms is that using the computer efficiently stores and locates qualitative data. Although the\nresearcher still needs to go through each line of text (as in hand coding by going through transcriptions)\nand assign codes, this computer process may be faster and more efficient than hand coding. Also, in\nlarge databases, the researcher can quickly locate all passages (or text segments) coded the same and\ndetermine whether participants respond to a codes idea in similar or different ways. Beyond this, the\ncomputer program can facilitate relating different codes (e.g., How do males and females—the first\ncodes of gender—differ in their attitudes to smoking—a second code?). These are a few features of the",

        "text": "software programs that make them a logical choice for qualitative data analysis over hand coding. As\nwith any software program, qualitative software programs require time and skill to learn and employ\neffectively, although books for learning the programs are widely available. Software programs do not\nanalyze the data; it is the researcher’s responsibility to conduct the analysis. Demos are available for\npopular qualitative data analysis software programs, such as MAXqda® (www.maxqda.com/), Atlas.ti®\n(www.atlasti.com), Provalis and QDA Miner (https://provalisresearch.com/), Dedoose™\n(www.dedoose.com/), and QSR NVivo® (www.qsrinternational.com/).\nSteps in the Analytic Process\nAs a research tip, we urge researchers to look at qualitative data analysis as a process that requires\nsequential steps to be followed, from the specific to the general, and involves multiple levels of analysis.\nFigure 9.3 presents a diagram of this process.\nStep 1. Organizing and Preparing the Data for Analysis\nThis involves transcribing interviews, optically scanning material, typing up field notes, cataloging all the\nvisual material, and sorting and arranging the data into different types depending on the sources of\ninformation.\nStep 2. Reading Through All the Data\nThis step provides a general sense of the information and an opportunity to reflect on its overall meaning.\nWhat general ideas are participants saying? What is the tone of the ideas? What is the impression of the\noverall depth, credibility, and use of the information? Sometimes qualitative researchers write notes in\nmargins of transcripts or observational field notes, or start recording general thoughts about the data at\nthis stage. For visual data, a sketchbook of ideas can begin to take shape.\nStep 3. Coding the Data\nCoding is the process of organizing the data by bracketing chunks (or text or image segments) and\nwriting a word representing a category in the margins (Rossman & Rallis, 2012). It involves taking text\ndata or pictures gathered during data collection, segmenting sentences (or paragraphs) or images into\ncategories, and labeling those categories with a term, often based in the actual language of the\nparticipant (called an in vivo term). More will be discussed on this important step later in this chapter.\nStep 4. Identifying Themes\nUse the coding process to generate a description of the setting or people and categories or themes for\nanalysis. Use the coding to generate a small number of themes or categories—perhaps five to seven\nthemes for a research study. The themes could be (a) a description of the setting or individual or (b)\nthemes learned about the problem. These themes are the ones that appear as major findings in\nqualitative studies and are often used as headings in the findings sections of studies (or in a section of a\ndissertation or thesis). They should display multiple perspectives from individuals and include diverse\nquotations and specific evidence.",

Developing a Story Line Interpretation\nQualitative researchers can do much with themes beyond identifying the themes during the coding\nprocess to build additional layers of complex analysis. For example, researchers interconnect themes into\na story line to present a chronology of development about the problem. The story line could also focus\non single individuals or groups of individuals. Story lines often appear in a discussion section in a journal\narticle report.\nStep 6. Further Analyzing the Data Using an Analytic Framework\nSteps 1–5 essentially provide a code-to-theme type of qualitative analysis, a descriptive methods\nanalysis discussed earlier. Researchers can use the code-to-theme method but then further analyze their\ndata using an interpretive framework such as narrative research, grounded theory, ethnography, case\nstudy, or other analytic frameworks available in the literature.\nStep 7.

        "text": "Advance how the description and themes will be represented in the qualitative narrative. The most\npopular approach is to use a narrative passage to convey the findings of the analysis. This might be a\ndiscussion that mentions a chronology of events, a detailed discussion of several themes (complete with\nsubthemes, specific illustrations, multiple perspectives from individuals, and quotations) or a discussion\nwith interconnecting themes. Many qualitative researchers also use visuals, figures, or tables as adjuncts\nto the discussions. They present a process model (as in grounded theory), advance a drawing of the\nspecific research site (as in ethnography), or convey descriptive information about each participant in a\ntable (as in case studies and ethnographies).\nCoding the Data\nStep 3 in the analytical process deserves special mention because it is a core component of qualitative\ndata analysis. A framework for conducting coding is shown in Table 9.4. Tesch (1990) provided the eight\nsteps typically used in forming codes and themes (categories). In addition, give some attention to the\ntypes of codes to develop when analyzing a text transcript or a picture (or other type of visual object).\nTable 9.4 Tesch’s Eight Steps in the Coding Process\n1. Get a sense of the whole. Read all the transcriptions carefully. Perhaps jot down some ideas as\nthey come to mind as you read.\n2. Pick one document (e.g., one interview)—the most interesting one, the shortest, the one on the\ntop of the pile. Go through it, asking yourself, “What is this about?” Do not think about the\nsubstance of the information but its underlying meaning. Write thoughts in the margin.\n3. When you have completed this task for several participants, make a list of all topics. Cluster\ntogether similar topics. Form these topics into columns, perhaps arrayed as major, unique, and\nleftover topics.\n4. Now take this list and go back to your data. Abbreviate the topics as codes, and write the codes\nnext to the appropriate segments of the text. Try this preliminary organizing scheme to see if\nnew categories and codes emerge.\n5. Find the most descriptive wording for your topics, and turn them into categories. Look for ways\nof reducing your total list of categories by grouping topics that relate to each other. Perhaps\ndraw lines between your categories to show interrelationships.\n6. Make a final decision on the abbreviation for each category, and alphabetize these codes.\n7. Assemble the data material belonging to each category in one place, and perform a preliminary\nanalysis.\n8. If necessary, recode your existing data.",

        "text": "Beyond this general coding process, we tend to think about codes as falling into expected, surprising,\nand unusual codes.\nExpected Codes\nBased on the literature and common sense, code on topics that readers would expect to find. When\nstudying bullying in schools, we might code some segments as “attitudes toward oneself.” This code\nwould be expected in a study about bullying in schools.\nSurprising Codes\nCode on findings that are surprising and could not be anticipated before the study began. In a study of\nleadership in nonprofit organizations, we might learn about the impact of geo-warming on the building of\nthe organization and how this shapes the location and proximity of individuals to one another. Without\ngoing out to the building before the study begins and looking at it, we would not necessarily think about\nthe codes of geo-warming and location of offices in a study of leadership.\nCodes of Unusual or Conceptual Interest\nCode unusual ideas and those that are, in and of themselves, of conceptual interest to readers. We used\none of the codes we discovered in our qualitative study of a campus’s response to a gunman (Asmussen\n& Creswell, 1995). We did not anticipate the code “retriggering” to emerge in our study, and it surfaced\nfrom the perspective of a psychologist called to the campus to assess the response. The fact that\nindividuals were reminded of past traumatic incidents—retriggering—prompted us to use the term as an\nimportant code and ultimately a theme in our analysis.\nPredetermined Codes\nAnother issue about coding is whether the researcher should (a) develop codes only from emerging\ninformation collected from participants, (b) use predetermined codes and then fit the data to them, or (c)\nuse some combination of emerging and predetermined codes. The traditional approach in the social\nsciences allows the codes to emerge during the data analysis. In the health sciences, a popular approach\nis to use predetermined codes based on the theory being examined.\nThe researchers might develop a qualitative codebook, a table containing a list of predetermined codes\nthat researchers use to code the data. Guest and colleagues (2012) discussed and illustrated the use of\ncodebooks in qualitative research. The intent of a codebook is to provide definitions for codes and to\nmaximize coherence among codes—especially when multiple codes are involved. This codebook would\nprovide a list of codes, a code label for each code, a brief definition of it, a full definition of it, information\nabout when to use the code and when not to use it, and an example of a quote illustrating the code. This\ncodebook can evolve and change during a study based on close analysis of the data when the researcher\nis not starting from an emerging code perspective. For researchers who have a distinct theory they want\nto test in their projects, we recommend developing a preliminary codebook for coding the data from the\ntheory and then permitting the codebook to develop and change based on the information learned during\nthe data analysis.\nVisual Images as Codes\nAs mentioned earlier, visual data are used frequently in qualitative research. These data sources\nrepresent images drawn from photographs, videos, film, and drawings (Creswell & Poth, 2018).\nParticipants might be handed a camera and asked to take pictures of what they see. Alternatively, they\nmay be asked to draw a picture of the phenomenon under study or reflect on a favorite picture or object\nthat would elicit responses. Challenges in using visual images do arise in qualitative research. Images\nmay reflect trends of the culture or society rather than the perspectives of a single individual. It is difficult\nto respect anonymity when images of individuals and places represent qualitative data. Permissions are\nneeded to respect the privacy of individuals providing visual data.",

        "text": "INTERPRETATION\nInterpretation in qualitative research involves several procedures: summarizing the overall findings,\ncomparing the findings to the literature, discussing a personal view of the findings, and stating limitations\nand future research. In terms of overall findings, the question “What were the lessons learned?” captures\nthe essence of this idea (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). These lessons could be the researcher’s interpretation\ncouched in the understanding that the inquirer brings to the study a personal culture, history, and\nexperiences.\nIt could also be a meaning derived from comparing the findings with information gleaned from the\nliterature or theories. In this way, the authors suggest that the findings confirm past information or diverge\nfrom it. It can also suggest new questions that need to be asked—questions raised by the data and\nanalysis that the inquirer had not foreseen earlier in the study. Wolcott (1994) said that ethnography can\nend a study by stating further questions. The questioning approach is also used in transformative\napproaches to qualitative research.\nMoreover, qualitative researchers can form interpretations that call for action agendas for reform and\nchange when using a theoretical lens. Researchers might describe how the narrative outcome compares\nwith theories and the general literature on the topic. Researchers also discuss the literature at the end of\nthe study (see Chapter 2). Thus, interpretation in qualitative research can take many forms; be adapted\nfor different types of designs; and be flexible to convey personal, research-based, and action meanings.\nFinally, part of interpretation involves suggesting limitations in a project and advancing future research\ndirections. Limitations often attach to the methods of a study (e.g., inadequate purposeful sampling,\ndifficulty in recruitment), and they represent weaknesses in the research that the author acknowledges so\nthat future studies will not suffer from the same problems. Suggestions for future proposed research\nthemes that studies might address to advance the literature, remedy some of the weaknesses in the\npresent study, or advance new leads or directions that can point to useful applications or knowledge.\nVALIDITY AND RELIABILITY\nAlthough validation of findings occurs throughout the steps in the research process, this discussion\nfocuses on how the researcher writes a passage in a proposal or study on the procedures to be\nundertaken to validate the qualitative proposed study’s findings. Researchers need to convey the steps\nthey will take in their studies to check for the accuracy and credibility of their findings. Validity does not\ncarry the same connotations in qualitative research as quantitative research; nor is it a companion to\nreliability (examining stability) or generalizability (the external validity of applying results to new settings,\npeople, or samples), topics discussed in Chapter 8. Qualitative validity means that the researcher\nchecks for the accuracy of the findings by employing certain procedures. In contrast, qualitative\nreliability indicates that the researcher’s approach is consistent across different researchers and among\ndifferent projects (Gibbs, 2007).\nDefining Qualitative Validity\nValidity is one of the strengths of qualitative research and is based on determining whether the findings\nare accurate from the researcher’s standpoint, the participant, or the readers of an account (Creswell &\nMiller, 2000). Terms abound in the qualitative literature that addresses validity, such as trustworthiness,\nauthenticity, and credibility (Creswell & Miller, 2000), and it is a much-discussed topic (Lincoln et al.,\n2011). A procedural perspective that we recommend for research proposals is to identify and discuss\none or more strategies available to check the accuracy of the findings.\nValidity Strategies\nResearchers should actively incorporate validity strategies into their proposals. We recommend the use\nof multiple approaches, which should enhance the researcher’s ability to assess the accuracy of findings\nand convince readers of the accuracy. There are eight primary strategies, organized from those used\nmost frequently and easiest to implement to those used occasionally and more difficult to implement:",

        "text": "Triangulate different data sources by examining evidence from the sources and using it to build a\ncoherent evidence for themes. If themes are established based on converging several sources of\ndata or perspectives from participants, this process adds to the study’s validity.\nUse member checking to determine the accuracy of the qualitative findings by taking the final report\nor specific descriptions or themes back to participants and determining whether these participants\nfeel that they are accurate. This does not mean taking back the raw transcripts to check for\naccuracy; instead, the researcher takes back parts of the polished or semi-polished product, such as\nthe major findings, the themes, the case analysis, the grounded theory, the cultural description, and\nso forth. This procedure can involve conducting a follow-up focus group interview with participants in\nthe study and providing an opportunity for them to comment on the findings.\nUse a rich, thick description to convey the findings. This description may transport readers to the\nsetting and give the discussion an element of shared experiences. When qualitative researchers\nprovide detailed descriptions of the setting, for example, or offer many perspectives about a theme,\nthe results become more realistic and richer. This procedure can add to the validity of the findings.\nClarify the bias the researcher brings to the study. This self-reflection creates an open and honest\nnarrative that will resonate well with readers. Reflexivity has already been mentioned as a core\ncharacteristic of qualitative research. Good qualitative research contains comments by the\nresearchers about how their interpretation of the findings is shaped by their background, such as\ntheir gender, culture, history, and socioeconomic origin.\nPresent negative or discrepant information that runs counter to the themes. Because real life\ncomprises different perspectives that do not always coalesce, discussing contrary information adds\nto an account’s credibility. A researcher can accomplish this by discussing evidence about a theme.\nMost evidence will build a case for the theme. Researchers can also present information that\ncontradicts the general perspective of the theme. The account becomes more realistic and more\nvalid by presenting this contradictory evidence.\nSpend prolonged time in the field. The more experience that a researcher has with participants in\ntheir settings, the more accurate or valid will be the findings. In this way, the researcher develops an\nin-depth understanding of the phenomenon under study and can convey details about the site and the\npeople, which lends credibility to the narrative account.\nUse peer debriefing to enhance the accuracy of the account. This process involves locating a person\n(a peer debriefer) who reviews and asks questions about the qualitative study so that the account\nwill resonate with people other than the researcher. This strategy—involving an interpretation beyond\nthe researcher and reported by another person—adds validity to an account.\nUse an external auditor to review the entire project. As distinct from a peer debriefer, this auditor is\nnot familiar with the researcher or the project and can provide an objective assessment of the project\nthroughout the research process or after the study. The role is similar to that of a fiscal auditor, and\nspecific questions exist that auditors might ask (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Having an independent\ninvestigator look over many aspects of the project (e.g., the accuracy of transcription, the\nrelationship between the research questions and the data, and the level of data analysis from the\nraw data through interpretation) enhances the overall validity of a qualitative study.\nReliability Strategies\nHow do qualitative researchers check to determine if their approaches are reliable (i.e., consistent or\nstable)? Yin (2009) suggested that qualitative researchers need to document the procedures of their\ncase studies and to document as many of the steps of the procedures as possible. He also\nrecommended setting up a detailed case study protocol and database so that others can follow the\nprocedures. Gibbs (2007) suggested several qualitative reliability procedures:\nCheck transcripts to ensure they do not contain obvious mistakes made during transcription.\nMake sure that there is no change in the definition of codes, a shift in the meaning of the codes\nduring the coding process. This can be accomplished by continually comparing data with the codes",

        "text": "and by writing memos about the codes and their definitions (see the discussion on a qualitative\ncodebook).\nFor team research, coordinate the communication among the coders by regular documented\nmeetings and by sharing the analysis.\nCross-check codes developed by different researchers by comparing results that are derived\nindependently.\nIntercoder Agreement\nProposal and project writers need to include several procedures as evidence that they will have\nconsistent results in their proposed study. We recommend that several procedures be mentioned in a\nproposal and that single researchers find another person who can cross-check their codes for intercoder\nagreement (or cross-checking) (also see Guest et al., 2012; Creswell & Bàez, 2020). Such an\nintercoder agreement might be based on whether two or more coders agree on codes used for the\nsame passages in the text. It is not that they code the same passage of text; rather, they determine\nwhether another coder would code it with the same or a similar code. Reliability subprograms in\nqualitative computer software packages can then be used to determine the level of consistency of coding.\nMiles and Huberman (1994) recommended that the consistency of the coding be in agreement at least\n80% of the time for good qualitative reliability.\nQualitative Generalization\nQualitative generalization is a term used in a limited way in qualitative research. This form of inquiry\nintends not to generalize findings to individuals, sites, or places outside of those under study (see Gibbs,\n2007, for his cautionary note about qualitative generalizability). The value of qualitative research lies in the\ndetailed description and themes developed in the context of a specific site. Particularity rather than\ngeneralizability (Greene & Caracelli, 1997) is the hallmark of good qualitative research. However, there\nare a few discussions in the qualitative literature about generalizability, especially as applied to case\nstudy research in which the inquirer studies several cases. Yin (2009), for example, felt that qualitative\ncase study results can be generalized to some broader theory. When qualitative researchers study\nadditional cases and apply findings to the new cases, the generalization occurs. It is the same as the\nreplication logic used in experimental research. However, to repeat a case study’s findings in a new case\nsetting requires good documentation of qualitative procedures, such as a protocol for the problem and\nthe development of a thorough case study database.\nWRITING THE QUALITATIVE REPORT\nA plan for qualitative methods should end with some comments about the narrative that will emerge from\nthe data analysis. Numerous varieties of narratives exist, and examples from scholarly journals illustrate\nthese models. In a plan for a study, consider advancing several points about the narrative:\nThe basic procedure in reporting the results of a qualitative study is to develop descriptions and themes\nfrom the data (see Figure 9.3) and to present these descriptions and themes that convey multiple\nperspectives from participants and detailed descriptions of the setting or individuals. These results may\nalso provide a chronological narrative of an individual’s life (narrative research), a detailed description of\ntheir experiences (phenomenology), a theory generated from the data (grounded theory), a detailed\nportrait of a culture-sharing group (ethnography), and an in-depth analysis of one or more cases (case\nstudy) or themes (descriptive method).\nGiven these different strategies, the findings and interpretation sections of a plan for a study might\ndiscuss how the sections will be presented: as objective accounts, fieldwork experiences (Van\nMaanen, 1988), a chronology, a process model, an extended story, an analysis by cases or across\ncases, or a detailed descriptive portrait.\nWriting Strategies",

Miller’s project was an\nethnographic study of the first-year experiences of the president of a 4-year college. As we present this\ndiscussion, we refer to the sections addressed in this chapter and highlight them in boldfaced type. Also,\nwe have maintained Miller’s use of the term informant, although today, researchers use the more\nappropriate term, participant. Here is the example:\nThe Qualitative Research Paradigm\nThe qualitative research paradigm has its roots in cultural anthropology and American sociology (Kirk &\nMiller, 1986). It has only recently been adopted by educational researchers (Borg & Gall, 1989). The\nintent of qualitative research is to understand a particular social situation, event, role, group, or interaction\n(Locke et al., 1987). It is largely an investigative process where the researcher gradually makes sense of\na social phenomenon by contrasting, comparing, replicating, cataloguing, and classifying the object of\nstudy (Miles & Huberman, 1984). Marshall and Rossman (1989) have suggested that this entails\nimmersion in the everyday life of the setting chosen for the study; the researcher enters the informants’\nworld and, through ongoing interaction, seeks the informants’ perspectives and meanings. [Qualitative\nassumptions are mentioned.]\nScholars contend that qualitative research can be distinguished from quantitative methodology by\nnumerous unique characteristics that are inherent in the design. The following is a synthesis of commonly\narticulated assumptions regarding characteristics presented by various researchers.\n1. Qualitative research occurs in natural settings, where human behavior and events occur.\n2. Qualitative research is based on assumptions that are different from quantitative designs. Theory or\nhypotheses are not established a priori.\n3. The researcher is the primary instrument in data collection rather than some inanimate mechanism\n(Eisner, 1991; Fraenkel & Wallen, 1990; Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Merriam, 1988).\n4. The data that emerge from a qualitative study are descriptive. That is, data are reported in words\n(primarily the participant’s words) or pictures rather than in numbers (Fraenkel & Wallen, 1990;\nLocke et al., 1987; Marshall & Rossman, 2022; Merriam, 1988).\n5. The focus of qualitative research is on participants’ perceptions and experiences and the way they\nmake sense of their lives (Fraenkel & Wallen, 1990; Locke et al., 1987; Merriam, 1988). The attempt\nis therefore to understand not one but multiple realities (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).\n6. Qualitative research focuses on the process that is occurring as well as the product or outcome.\nResearchers are particularly interested in understanding how things occur (Fraenkel & Wallen, 1990;\nMerriam, 1988).\n7. Idiographic interpretation is utilized. In other words, attention is paid to particulars, and data is\ninterpreted in regard to the particulars of a case rather than generalizations.\n8. Qualitative research is an emergent design in its negotiated outcomes. Meanings and interpretations\nare negotiated with human data sources because it is the subjects’ realities that the researcher",

        "text": "attempts to reconstruct (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Merriam, 1988).\n9. This research tradition relies on the utilization of tacit knowledge (intuitive and felt knowledge)\nbecause often the nuances of the multiple realities can be appreciated most in this way (Lincoln &\nGuba, 1985). Therefore, data are not quantifiable in the traditional sense of the word.\n10. Objectivity and truthfulness are critical to both research traditions. However, the criteria for judging a\nqualitative study differ from quantitative research. First and foremost, the researcher seeks\nbelievability based on coherence, insight and instrumental utility (Eisner, 1991), and trustworthiness\n(Lincoln & Guba, 1985) through a process of verification rather than through traditional validity and\nreliability measures. [Qualitative characteristics are mentioned.]\nThe Ethnographic Research Design\nThis study will utilize the ethnographic research tradition. This design emerged from the field of\nanthropology, primarily from the contributions of Bronislaw Malinowski, Robert Park, and Franz Boas\n(Jacob, 1987; Kirk & Miller, 1986). The intent of ethnographic research is to obtain a holistic picture of\nthe subject of study with emphasis on portraying the everyday experiences of individuals by observing\nand interviewing them and relevant others (Fraenkel & Wallen, 1990). The ethnographic study includes in-\ndepth interviewing and continual and ongoing participant observation of a situation (Jacob, 1987) and in\nattempting to capture the whole picture reveals how people describe and structure their world (Fraenkel\n& Wallen, 1990). [The author uses the ethnographic approach.]\nThe Researcher’s Role\nParticularly in qualitative research, the role of the researcher as the primary data collection instrument\nnecessitates the identification of personal values, assumptions, and biases at the outset of the study. The\ninvestigator’s contribution to the research setting can be useful and positive rather than detrimental\n(Locke et al., 1987). My perceptions of higher education and the college presidency have been shaped\nby my personal experiences. From August 1980 to May 1990, I served as a college administrator on\nprivate campuses of 600 to 5,000 students. Most recently (1987–1990), I served as the dean for student\nlife at a small college in the Midwest. As a member of the president’s cabinet, I was involved with all top-\nlevel administrative cabinet activities and decisions and worked closely with the faculty, cabinet officers,\npresident, and board of trustees. In addition to reporting to the president, I worked with him through his\nfirst year in office. I believe this understanding of the context and role enhances my awareness,\nknowledge, and sensitivity to many of the challenges, decisions, and issues encountered as a first-year\npresident and will assist me in working with the informant in this study. I bring knowledge of both the\nstructure of higher education and of the role of the college presidency. Particular attention will be paid to\nthe role of the new president in initiating change, relationship building, decision-making, and providing\nleadership and vision.\nDue to previous experiences working closely with a new college president, I bring certain biases to this\nstudy. Although every effort will be made to ensure objectivity, these biases may shape the way I view\nand understand the data I collect and the way I interpret my experiences. I commence this study with the\nperspective that the college presidency is a diverse and often difficult position. Although expectations are\nimmense, I question how much power the president has to initiate change and provide leadership and\nvision. I view the first year as critical: filled with adjustments, frustrations, unanticipated surprises, and\nchallenges. [Author reflects on her role in the study.]\nBounding the Study\nSetting\nThis study will be conducted on the campus of a state college in the Midwest. The college is situated in a\nrural Midwestern community. The institution’s 1,700 students nearly triple the town’s population of 1,000\nwhen classes are in session. The institution awards associate, bachelor, and master’s degrees in 51\nmajors.\nActors",

        "text": "The informant in this study is the new president of a state college in the Midwest. The primary informant\nin this study is the president. However, I will be observing him in the context of administrative cabinet\nmeetings. The president’s cabinet includes three vice presidents (Academic Affairs, Administration,\nStudent Affairs) and two deans (Graduate Studies and Continuing Education).\nEvents\nUsing ethnographic research methodology, the focus of this study will be the everyday experiences and\nevents of the new college president and the perceptions and meaning attached to those experiences as\nexpressed by the informant. This includes the assimilation of surprising events or information and making\nsense of critical events and issues that arise.\nProcesses\nParticular attention will be paid to the role of the new president in initiating change, relationship building,\ndecision-making, and providing leadership and vision. [Author mentions data collection boundaries.]\nEthical Considerations\nMost authors who discuss qualitative research design address the importance of ethical considerations\n(Locke et al., 1982; Marshall & Rossman, 2022; Merriam, 1988; Spradley, 1980). First and foremost, the\nresearcher has an obligation to respect the rights, needs, values, and desires of the informant(s). To an\nextent, ethnographic research is always obtrusive. Participant observation invades the life of the\ninformant (Spradley, 1980), and sensitive information is frequently revealed. This is of particular concern\nin this study where the informant’s position and institution are highly visible. The following safeguards will\nbe employed to protect the informant’s rights: (a) the research objectives will be articulated verbally and\nin writing so that they are clearly understood by the informant (including a description of how data will be\nused); (b) written permission to proceed with the study as articulated will be received from the informant;\n(c) a research exemption form will be filed with the IRB (Appendixes B1 and B2); (d) the informant will be\ninformed of all data collection devices and activities; (e) verbatim transcriptions and written interpretations\nand reports will be made available to the informant; (f) the informant’s rights, interests, and wishes will be\nconsidered first when choices are made regarding reporting the data; and (g) the final decision regarding\ninformant anonymity will rest with the informant. [Author addresses ethical issues and IRB review.]\nData Collection Strategies\nData will be collected from February through May 1992. This will include a minimum of bi-monthly, 45-\nminute recorded interviews with the informant (initial interview questions, Appendix C), bi-monthly 2-hour\nobservations of administrative cabinet meetings, bi-monthly 2-hour observations of daily activities, and bi-\nmonthly analysis of the president’s calendar and documents (meeting minutes, memos, publications). In\naddition, the informant has agreed to record impressions of his experiences, thoughts, and feelings in a\ntaped diary (guidelines for recorded reflection, Appendix D). Two follow-up interviews will be scheduled\nfor the end of May 1992 (see Appendix E for the proposed timeline and activity schedule). [The author\nproposed to use face-to-face interviews, participate as observer, and obtain private documents.]\nTo assist in the data collection phase, I will utilize a field log, providing a detailed account of ways I plan\nto spend my time when I am on site and in the transcription and analysis phase (also comparing this\nrecord to how time is actually spent). I intend to record details related to my observations in a field\nnotebook and keep a field diary to chronicle my own thinking, feeling, experiences, and perceptions\nthroughout the research process. [The author records descriptive and reflective information.]\nData Analysis Procedures\nMerriam (1988) and Marshall and Rossman (1989) contend that data collection and data analysis must\nbe a simultaneous process in qualitative research. Schatzman and Strauss (1973) have claimed that\nqualitative data analysis primarily entails classifying things, persons, and events and the properties that\ncharacterize them. Typically throughout the data analysis process ethnographers index or code their data\nusing as many categories as possible (Jacob, 1987). They seek to identify and describe patterns and",

        "text": "themes from the perspective of the participant(s), then attempt to understand and explain these patterns\nand themes (Agar, 1980). During data analysis, the data will be organized categorically and\nchronologically, reviewed repeatedly, and continually coded. A list of major ideas that surface will be\nchronicled (as suggested by Merriam, 1988). Taped interviews and the participant’s taped diary will be\ntranscribed verbatim. Field notes and diary entries will be regularly reviewed. [Author describes steps\nin data analysis.]\nIn addition, the data analysis process will be aided by the use of a qualitative data analysis computer\nprogram called HyperQual. Raymond Padilla (Arizona State University) designed HyperQual in 1987 for\nuse with the Macintosh computer. HyperQual utilizes HyperCard software and facilitates the recording\nand analysis of textual and graphic data. Special stacks are designated to hold and organize data. Using\nHyperQual the researcher can directly “enter field data, including interview data, observations,\nresearcher’s memos, and illustrations . . . (and) tag (or code) all or part of the source data so that\nchunks of data can be pulled out and then be reassembled in a new and illuminating configuration”\n(Padilla, 1989, pp. 69–70). Meaningful data chunks can be identified, retrieved, isolated, grouped, and\nregrouped for analysis. Categories or code names can be entered initially or at a later date. Codes can\nbe added, changed, or deleted with HyperQual editor, and text can be searched for key categories,\nthemes, words, or phrases. [Author mentions the proposed use of computer software for data\nanalysis.]\nVerification\nIn ensuring internal validity, the following strategies will be employed:\n1. Triangulation of data—Data will be collected through multiple sources to include interviews,\nobservations, and document analysis.\n2. Member checking—The informant will serve as a check throughout the analysis process. An ongoing\ndialogue regarding my interpretations of the informant’s reality and meanings will ensure the truth\nvalue of the data.\n3. Long terms and repeated observations at the research site—Regular and repeated observations of\nsimilar phenomena and settings will occur on site over a 4-month period of time.\n4. Peer examination—a doctoral student and graduate assistant in the Educational Psychology\nDepartment will serve as a peer examiner.\n5. Participatory modes of research—The informant will be involved in most phases of this study, from\nthe design of the project to checking interpretations and conclusions.\n6. Clarification of researcher bias—At the outset of this study researcher bias will be articulated in\nwriting in the dissertation proposal under the heading “The Researcher’s Role.”\nThe primary strategy utilized in this project to ensure external validity will be the provision of rich, thick,\ndetailed descriptions so that anyone interested in transferability will have a solid framework for\ncomparison (Merriam, 1988). Three techniques to ensure reliability will be employed in this study. First,\nthe researcher will provide a detailed account of the focus of the study, the researcher’s role, the\ninformant’s position and basis for selection, and the context from which data will be gathered (LeCompte\n& Goetz, 1984). Second, triangulation or multiple methods of data collection and analysis will be used,\nwhich strengthens reliability as well as internal validity (Merriam, 1988). Finally, data collection and\nanalysis strategies will be reported in detail to provide a clear and accurate picture of the methods used\nin this study. All phases of this project will be subject to scrutiny by an external auditor who is\nexperienced in qualitative research methods. [Author identifies strategies of validity to be used in the\nstudy.]\nREPORTING THE FINDINGS\nLofland (1974) has suggested that although data collection and analysis strategies are similar across\nqualitative methods, the way the findings are reported is diverse. Miles and Huberman (1984) have\naddressed the importance of creating a data display and suggest that narrative text has been the most\nfrequent form of display for qualitative data. This is a naturalistic study. Therefore, the results will be\npresented in descriptive, narrative form rather than as a scientific report. Thick description will be the\nvehicle for communicating a holistic picture of the experiences of a new college president. The final\nproject will be a construction of the informant’s experiences and the meanings he attaches to them. This\nwill allow readers to vicariously experience the challenges he encounters and provide a lens through\nwhich readers can view the subject’s world. [Outcomes of the study are mentioned.]",

        "text": "Summary\nThis chapter explores the components of developing and writing a qualitative method section for a\nproposal. The chapter advances a general guideline for procedures. This guideline includes a\ndiscussion about the characteristics of qualitative research if audiences are not familiar with this\napproach to research. These characteristics are that data are based on participants’ meanings,\ntake place in the natural setting, rely on the researcher as the instrument for data collection,\nemploy multiple methods of data collection, use inductive and deductive thinking, include\nresearcher reflexivity, and are complex. This guideline recommends using a code-to-theme\ndescriptive method and then possibly adding on an analytic framework, such as the study of\nindividuals (narrative, phenomenology); the exploration of processes, activities, and events (case\nstudy, grounded theory); or the examination of broad culture-sharing behavior of individuals or\ngroups (ethnography). The choice of design needs to be presented and defended.\nFurther, the proposal or study needs to address the role of the researcher: past experiences,\nhistory, culture, and how this potentially shapes interpretations of the data. It also includes\ndiscussing personal connections to the site, steps to gain entry, and anticipating sensitive ethical\nissues. Discussion of data collection should advance the purposeful sampling approach and the\nforms of data to be collected (i.e., observations, interviews, documents, and audiovisual, media,\nand digital materials). It is useful to also indicate the use of data recording protocols. Data\nanalysis is an ongoing process during research. It involves analyzing participant information, and\nresearchers typically employ general analysis steps and those steps found within a specific design\nor approach. More general steps include organizing and preparing the data; an initial reading\nthrough the information; coding the data; developing from the codes a description and thematic\nanalysis; using computer programs; representing the findings in tables, graphs, and figures; and\ninterpreting the findings. These interpretations involve stating lessons learned, comparing the\nfindings with past literature and theory, raising questions, offering personal perspective, stating\nlimitations, and advancing an agenda for future research. The project should also contain a section\non the expected outcomes for the study. Finally, an additional important step in planning a\nproposal is to mention the strategies that will be used to validate the accuracy of the findings and\ndemonstrate the reliability of codes and themes.\nKEY TERMS\nAnalytic framework 196\nAudiovisual, social media, and digital materials 200\nCoding 207\nGatekeepers 199\nIntercoder agreement 215\nInterpretation in qualitative research 212\nInterview protocol 203\nMemos 195\nObservation protocol 203\nProbes 205\nPurposefully sample 198\nQualitative codebook 211\nQualitative computer software programs 206",

Create a justification for using mixed methods research in a proposal or study.\n3. Define key terms used in mixed methods, such as open- and closed-ended data, research\ndesign, integration, joint displays, and metainferences when presented in a proposal or study.\n4. Contrast quantitative and qualitative data when presented in a study.\n5. Identify for a core design its intent, procedures for data collection, integration,\nmetainferences, and validity.\n6. Choose a type of mixed methods design for a study, and present reasons for the choice.\n7. Identify the elements that go into an integration statement for a proposal or a study.\nINTRODUCTION\nUp until this point, we have considered writing quantitative and qualitative methods. We have not\ndiscussed “mixing” or combining the two forms of data in a study: a mixed methods procedure. We can\nstart with the assumption that both forms of data provide different types of information (open-ended data\nin the case of qualitative and closed-ended data in the case of quantitative). Suppose we further assume\nthat each type of data collection has both limitations and strengths. In that case we can consider how to\ncombine the strengths to develop a stronger understanding of the research problem or questions (and\novercome the limitations of each). In a sense, more insight into a problem must be gained from mixing or\nintegrating the quantitative and qualitative data. This “mixing” or integrating of data provides a stronger\nunderstanding of the problem or question than either by itself. Mixed methods research is simply “mining”\nthe databases more by integrating them. This idea is at the core of a new methodology called “mixed\nmethods research.”\nTable 10.1 shows a checklist of the mixed methods procedures addressed in this chapter. The checklist\nfollows the chapter topics and some important terms for engaging in this methodology.\nTable 10.1 A Checklist of Questions for Designing a Mixed Methods Procedure\n______ Have you defined mixed methods research?\n______ Do you justify using mixed methods methodology for your problem and question?",

Understanding\nsome of its history is important to pose a good rationale for using it. In its 35-year history mixed methods\nresearch has evolved into a complete methodology with clear descriptions of major elements that go into\nits research, such as problems, data collection, data analysis, interpretation, and written products. It has\nbeen called the “third methodological movement” (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010) alongside the other two—\nquantitative and qualitative research. It sits between these two other methodologies and incorporates\nboth.\nSeveral texts outline the major development of the methodology (e.g., Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018;\nTeddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). It emerged roughly during 1985–1990 when several scholars, working\nindependently from diverse disciplines (e.g., management, education, sociology, medicine) began crafting\nbooks and journal articles about the research approach (Bryman, 1988; Greene et al., 1989). By the late\n1990s and early 2000s, specific books articulated the new methodology (e.g., Tashakkori & Teddlie,\n1998). In 2003, the Handbook of Mixed Methods in the Social and Behavior Sciences (Tashakkori &\nTeddlie, 2003) firmly set the large dimensions of the new field of mixed methods research. By 2007, the\nfield had its first dedicated journal in the Journal of Mixed Methods Research. By 2011, the U.S. federal\ngovernment took an active interest in mixed methods. It issued a report and then updated it called the\n“Best Practices of Mixed Methods Research in the Health Sciences” (National Institutes of Health, Office\nof Behavioral and Social Sciences, 2011, 2018).\nAn international community of mixed methods scholars formed, and by 2014 the Mixed Methods\nInternational Research Association (MMIRA) was born. This association soon expanded internationally\ninto specific countries worldwide starting chapters, affiliate groups, and regional conferences. Training\nprograms in mixed methods research soon emerged in 2015, such as the NIH Mixed Methods Research\nTraining Program, housed at Johns Hopkins University, Harvard, and the University of Michigan. Training\nworkshops started at the Mixed Methods Research Program at the University of Michigan. More recently\nthe American Psychological Association included standards for mixed methods research in its Publication\nManual (American Psychological Association, 2020), signaling that mixed methods had found its way into\nthe internationally popular style manual for the first time. Today, many empirical studies in various fields\nhave used mixed methods, innovations have expanded through methodological journal articles, and many\nbooks are available on the subject (Molina-Azorin & Fetters, 2022).",

        "text": "CHARACTERISTICS OF MIXED METHODS RESEARCH\nUnderstanding mixed methods’ growth and popularity helps frame this methodology in a dissertation or a\nstudy. It is helpful to use the term mixed methods when referring to this approach. Other terms are\navailable in the literature, such as integrating, synthesis, quantitative and qualitative methods,\nmultimethod, mixed research, or mixed methodology, but the term “mixed methods” has become\npopular in the field through numerous writings (Bryman, 2006; Creswell, 2022; Tashakkori & Teddlie,\n2010). Multimethod research refers to the collection of multiple quantitative or qualitative sources of data\nand is not mixed methods research. In contrast, mixed methods research collects both quantitative and\nqualitative data.\nThe following defining characteristics, including collecting both forms of data, are central to understanding\nand describing mixed methods research. We recognize that many definitions are available in the literature\n(see varied scholars’ views of defining mixed methods research in Johnson et al., 2007). However, for a\nmixed methods study or proposal, include the following specific components (see Figure 10.1 for a visual\ndiagram of these characteristics):\nDescription\nFigure 10.1 Essential Components of Mixed Methods Research\nThe researcher:\nCollects two types of data—qualitative (open-ended) and quantitative (closed-ended) data—to\nstudy the research problem or question\nConnects the two data sets, called integration\nUses procedures to integrate the two data sets, called a mixed methods design\nAnalyzes integration typically in a table, called a joint display, by representing the two databases\ntogether in the procedures\nDraws conclusions, insight, or interpretation from the integration analysis, called metainferences\nFrames the study with the researcher’s beliefs, values (worldview), and explanations drawn from the\nliterature (theories).\nIn Chapter 1 we mentioned the importance of framing these procedures within the personal perspective\nof the researcher (worldview) and in explanations drawn typically from the literature (theories). In Figure\n10.1, the components of a definition will be emphasized in the sections to follow. These topics also\nprovide a good overview of the entire field of mixed methods research. Writings on mixed methods drill\ndown in detail on each of these topics, something beyond the scope of this book. However, references at\nthe end of this chapter should guide readers toward deeper explanations. Thus, a mixed methods section",

        "text": "should begin by defining mixed methods research and advancing its definition based on its essential\ncharacteristics. This discussion should also include reasons for selecting the methodology.\nJUSTIFICATION FOR USING MIXED METHODS RESEARCH\nNumerous reasons can justify the use of mixed methods research in a project. Researchers may have\naccess to both quantitative and qualitative data; advisers may recommend it as a recent, popular\nmethodology; funding sources may require it; and individuals may simply want to practice applying it to\ntheir topics. In addition, it does provide for the use of two different types of data. It encourages the\nfurther “mining” of the data beyond the results yielded by either the quantitative or qualitative databases.\nIt seems suitable for studying the complex problems of today that require gathering numbers and hearing\nthe voices of individuals. For example, a good illustration would be the research and reports about the\npandemic where we daily view statistics on new cases and hear the stories about individuals resisting the\nvaccinations. Mixed methods can also be attractive to private foundations and federal agencies that now\nencourage the use of this methodology. A useful addition for individuals trained in quantitative research\nwould be to collect qualitative data to provide evidence to back up the numbers.\nThese are all important reasons for using this methodology. However, added to this list would be the\nreasons for combining the two databases and the insight that yields. This insight provides more\ninformation than simply reporting the quantitative and qualitative results. What possible insights might\nemerge from combining or linking the quantitative and qualitative databases? Here are some possibilities:\nDeveloping a complete understanding of a research problem by combining the quantitative and\nqualitative results\nExplaining quantitative results in more detail with qualitative data\nImproving measures, scales, and instruments by incorporating the views of participants who received\nthe instruments\nAugmenting experiments or trials by incorporating the perspectives of individuals\nDeveloping cases (i.e., organizations, units, or programs) or documenting diverse cases for\ncomparisons\nEvaluating programs based on combining quantitative and qualitative data\nDeveloping a complete understanding of changes needed for a marginalized group through the\ncombination of qualitative and quantitative data\nDEFINITIONS OF MIXED METHODS TERMS\nTerms introduced in this chapter may be new to readers, and we begin by defining key terms so that\nresearchers can begin to build their language of mixed methods research.\nOpen- and Closed-Ended Data\nOpen-ended data consists of information gathered where the researchers ask a question but do not\nprovide a response option. Instead, the participants share their views, and the researcher records them.\nAs applied to qualitative observations and documents, the researcher does not use a predetermined set\nof response options but observes or looks at documents to see meaning.\nClosed-ended data consists of information gathered where the researcher provides participants with\nresponse options, such as rating scales from strongly agree to strongly disagree. We feel that\ndistinguishing the two types of data is more specific than referring to numbers versus texts or numeric\ndata versus stories. Some data sources can be both closed- and open-ended, such as health data with\nclosed-ended scores on medical tests and open-ended information from recording a patient’s history.",

        "text": "Research Design\nThe research design is the procedure used in conducting a study. They extend from the broad\nphilosophical assumptions to the data interpretation. As used for a mixed methods design, this refers to\nthe procedures in the research process of collecting data, analyzing data, and interpreting it. Two\ncategories of designs will be discussed here, recognizing that many types have emerged over the years\n(Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Creswell & Plano Clark, in press). We advanced core designs including\nconvergent designs, explanatory sequential designs, and exploratory sequential designs. These designs\nare found in all mixed methods studies. Further, these core designs can be embedded within more\nexpansive processes or frameworks. Here the primary intent is not simply the integration of the two\ndatabases but to have mixed methods support the procedures of a process or framework. We call these\ncomplex designs. Complex designs presented in this chapter include experimental processes,\nparticipatory action research frameworks, case study procedures, and evaluation processes. Rather than\na long list of types of designs, we feel that most studies can fit into these core and complex designs.\nIntegration\nIntegration represents a central concept in mixed methods research. This important concept involves\ncombining or “mixing” in a study or a series of studies information from the quantitative and qualitative\ndata. Integration in our discussion will consist of reasons or “intent” of combining the two databases and\nthe “procedures” of enacting this combination. Further, integration differs depending on the type of mixed\nmethods design. In terms of procedures the researcher either merges or combines the two databases or\nconnects them by one building on the other. For complex designs, the integration involves embedding one\nor more core designs into a larger process or framework, such as an experiment, evaluation, or a\nparticipant action research project.\nJoint Display\nIn the procedures of combining data, the researcher needs some way to examine the effect of bringing\nthe two databases together. A joint display is a table or graph that presents the side-by-side\ncombination of the two databases. Joint displays differ for types of designs because the procedures for\ncombining vary by designs.\nMetainferences\nAs a researcher examines the joint display table or graph, conclusions are drawn about the insight\nemerging from comparing the two databases. In mixed methods, these insights are called\nmetainferences, which suggests that a researcher concludes quantitative and qualitative inferences and\nthen draws additional inferences (metainferences) based on combining the quantitative and qualitative\ndatabases.\nTHE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A MIXED METHODS STUDY\nThe process of conducting a mixed methods study involves connecting the quantitative and qualitative\ndata to a specific type of mixed methods design. In this design, the researcher draws a diagram of the\ndesign, integrates the two databases, presents the integration in a table or joint display for analysis, and\ndraws insight or metainferences from the results of the integration.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION\nIn mixed methods procedures, after defining the methodology with key characteristics and a rationale for\nits use, the researcher needs to indicate the types of qualitative and quantitative data collected. We start\nwith the data discussion because it is concrete and easily grasped by readers. Our approach involves\nthinking about this form of research as gathering both quantitative and qualitative data and then combining\nthem. In this way, a researcher learns more about the problem under study because insights go beyond\nsimply learning about the quantitative and qualitative results; learning comes from the combination or\nintegration of the two databases. In this spirit, we talk about “mining” the data further when using mixed",

        "text": "methods research. If a researcher can gather both quantitative and qualitative data, then an opportunity\nopens for the use of mixed methods research.\nOne helpful strategy is to pose a general problem for the mixed methods study and gather two types of\ndata—quantitative and qualitative—to address this problem. The types of research problems studied by\nmixed methods researchers span many fields and topics, and we see empirical mixed methods studies\nreported in a wide assortment of social, behavioral, and health science journals today.\nIn conducting mixed methods research, these two forms provide different types of data to answer the\ngeneral research problem or question because one is open-ended and the other closed- ended\ninformation. Mixed methods researchers can profit from developing a table for a proposal or report that\nspecifies both the quantitative and qualitative data sources. To bring the two databases together in\nintegration, one needs to have a clear sense of the types of data gathered.\nWe recommend composing and presenting in a proposal or report a table that lists the sources of\nquantitative and qualitative data in a project. The source can be named (e.g., attitudinal instrument,\ninterview); the number of people, observations, or documents collected; and specific details about the\nsources (e.g., the specific instrument and scales, the online interviews).\nCore Mixed Methods Designs\nThere have been several typologies for classifying and identifying types of mixed methods procedures\nthat researchers might use in their proposed mixed methods study. Creswell and Plano Clark (2018)\nidentified several classification systems drawn from the fields of evaluation, nursing, public health,\neducation policy and research, and social and behavioral research. In these classifications, authors have\nused diverse terms for their types of designs, and a substantial amount of overlap of types has existed in\nthe typologies. For purposes of clarifying the design discussion in the mixed methods field, we will identify\nthree core mixed methods designs as shown in Figure 10.2—the convergent design, the explanatory\nsequential design, and the exploratory sequential design. Then we will identify more designs, called\ncomplex designs (or embedded designs), in which the core designs are embedded within a framework or\nprocess beyond mixed methods. We begin with the three core designs and indicate the intent for using\neach, the general procedures, and the issues of validity and ethics.\nThe Convergent Mixed Methods Design\nThe intent of the convergent design is to compare the results from the qualitative databases with those\nfrom the quantitative database by merging the results (see Figure 10.2). The key assumption of this\napproach is that both qualitative and quantitative data provide different types of information. These types\nare detailed views of participants, qualitative, and scores on instruments, quantitative. Together they yield\nresults that should be the same. In past years, we have described this design as a “concurrent” or\n“parallel” design. Focusing on comparing the two databases shifts the emphasis from the vague, historic\nwords of “concurrent” or “parallel” to the intent to compare the results. When comparing the results, the\nadditional purpose or intent may be to see if the findings converge (match) or diverge, mutually support a\nconstruct, or validate one form of data with another.\nThe convergent mixed methods design is probably the most familiar of the core and complex mixed\nmethods approaches. New researchers to mixed methods typically first think of this approach because\nthey feel that mixed methods comprise only combining the quantitative and qualitative data. It builds off\nthe historic concept of the multimethod, multi-trait idea from Campbell and Fiske (1959), who suggested\nunderstanding a psychological trait by gathering different forms of data. Although the Campbell and Fiske\nconceptualization included only quantitative data, the mixed methods researchers extended the idea to\ninclude quantitative and qualitative data collection.",

        "text": "Description\nFigure 10.2 Three Core Designs\nThe procedures for data collection in this single-phase approach involves the researcher collecting\nquantitative and qualitative data, analyzing them separately, and then comparing the results to see if the\nfindings confirm or disconfirm each other. The qualitative data assumes types discussed in Chapter 9,\nsuch as interviews, observations, documents, and records. The quantitative data can be instrument data,\nobservational checklists, or numeric records, such as census data, as discussed in Chapter 8. Ideally, the\nkey idea with this design is to collect both forms of data using the same or parallel variables, constructs,\nor concepts. For example, when researchers measure the concept of self-esteem during quantitative\ndata collection, they ask about the same concept during the qualitative data collection process. Some\nresearchers will use this design to associate themes with quantitative data and qualitative data. For\ninstance, Shaw et al. (2013) compared quality improvement practices in family medicine clinics with\ncolorectal cancer screening rates. Another data collection issue is the sample size for the qualitative and\nquantitative data collection process. Unquestionably, the data for the qualitative data collection will be\nsmaller than that for the quantitative data collection. This is because the intent of data collection for\nqualitative data is to locate and obtain information from a small purposeful sample and to gather\nextensive information from this sample; whereas, in quantitative research, a large N is needed to infer\nmeaningful statistical results from samples to a population.\nSometimes mixed methods researchers will collect information from the same number of individuals in the\nqualitative and quantitative databases. This means that the qualitative sample increases, limiting the\namount of data collected from any one individual. Another approach would be to weight the qualitative\ncases to equal the N in the quantitative database. One other approach taken by some mixed methods\nresearchers is not to consider the unequal sample sizes a problem. They would argue that the intent of\nqualitative and quantitative research differs (one to gain an in-depth perspective and the other to\ngeneralize to a population) and that each provides an adequate account. Another issue in sampling is\nwhether the individuals for the sample of qualitative participants should also be individuals in the\nquantitative sample. Typically, mixed methods researchers include the sample of qualitative participants in\nthe larger quantitative sample. Ultimately, researchers make a comparison between the two databases,\nand the more they are similar, the better the comparison.\nIntegrative data analysis in a convergent design comprises three phases. First, analyze the qualitative\ndatabase by coding the data and collapsing the codes into broad themes. Second, analyze the\nquantitative database in terms of statistical results. Third, conduct a mixed methods data analysis of the\nintegration of the two databases. Mixed methods data analysis can be called integration analysis.\nThere are several ways to integrate the two databases: First, researchers can make a side-by-side\ncomparison. Less frequently seen in the mixed methods literature today, these comparisons are found in\nthe discussion sections of mixed methods studies. The researcher will first report the quantitative\nstatistical results and then discuss the qualitative findings (e.g., themes) that either confirm or disconfirm\nthe statistical results. Alternatively, the researcher might start with the qualitative findings and then\ncompare them to the quantitative results. Mixed methods writers call this a side-by-side approach",

        "text": "because the researcher makes the comparison within a discussion, presenting first one set of findings\nand then the other.\nSecond, researchers can also merge the two databases by changing or transforming qualitative codes or\nthemes into quantitative variables and then combining the two quantitative databases—a procedure in\nmixed methods research called data transformation. To form quantitative measures the researcher\ntakes the qualitative themes or codes and counts them (and possibly groups them). Some useful\ntransformation procedures that mixed methods researchers have used can be found in Onwuegbuzie and\nLeech (2006). This approach is popular among researchers trained in quantitative research who may not\nsee the value of an independent qualitative interpretive database.\nThird, a final procedure involves merging the two forms of data in a table or a graph. This table or graph\nis called a joint display of data, and it can take many different forms. The joint display needs to relate to\nthe mixed methods design, and it has become a standard procedure for integrating the two databases in\nmixed methods studies. See the template for a convergent design joint display in Table 10.2. As shown in\nTable 10.2, we have constructed a template without actual data. A template is advantageous to learn\nabout joint displays because it shows the overall structure.\nTable 10.2 Template for a Convergent Design Joint Display\nScores Theme 1 Theme 2 Theme 3 Theme 4 Metainferences\nHigh Quote/Scores Quote/Scores Quote/Scores Quote/Scores Insight\nMedium Quote/Scores Quote/Scores Quote/Scores Quote/Scores Insight\nLow Quote/Scores Quote/Scores Quote/Scores Quote/Scores Insight\nMetainferences Insight Insight Insight Insight Insight\nMany joint displays are available in the mixed methods literature (see Guetterman et al., 2015). The joint\ndisplay shown in Table 10.2 arrays four themes on the horizontal axis and a categorical variable (high,\nmedium, and low scores) on the vertical axis. The information in the cells can be quotes, scores, or both.\nThe joint display can also be arrayed differently with a table with key questions or concepts on the\nvertical axis and then two columns on the horizontal axis indicating qualitative responses and quantitative\nresponses to the key questions or concepts (e.g., Li et al., 2000). The basic idea is for the researcher to\njointly display both forms of data—effectively merging them—in a single visual and then make an\ninterpretation of the display (see Guetterman et al., 2015).\nAs seen in Table 10.2, we added to the themes and scores a column and row for metainferences. In this\nway, the researcher can derive results by looking across the rows or columns with qualitative and\nquantitative data. For example, how do the scores for the high, medium, and low scoring individuals differ\nfor theme 1? How do the high-scoring individuals differ among the four themes? The process involves\nlooking across databases and drawing conclusions or insight from the analysis. This constitutes the mixed\nmethods analysis of integration of the two databases, and these insights can be added into a study in a\nresults section or a discussion section. Further, the researcher can look for types of integrative results,\nsuch as whether the qualitative and quantitative results provide confirmation of the databases, show",

        "text": "agreement (or concordance) or disagreement (discordance), expand knowledge beyond the databases,\nrelate to existing literature, or inform theories (see Molina-Azorin & Fetters, 2022, about metainferences).\nWhen divergence occurs, the researcher needs to conduct follow-up analysis. The researcher can state\ndivergence as a limitation in the study without further follow-up. This approach represents a weak\nsolution. Alternatively, mixed methods researchers can return to the analyses and further explore the\ndatabases. They also can collect additional information to resolve the differences or discuss limitations of\none of the databases (e.g., invalid quantitative constructs or a poor match between the open-ended\nquestion and the qualitative themes). Whatever approach the researcher takes, the key point in a\nconvergent design is to further discuss and probe results for divergent findings.\nWhat types of validity threats are likely to arise in a convergent design? Validity using the convergent\ndesign should be based on establishing both quantitative validity (e.g., construct) and qualitative validity\n(e.g., triangulation) for each database. Then, in mixed methods research, validity relates to the specific\ndesign used. When threats arise, they need to be addressed.\nIn a convergent design, one validity threat involves not following up with the two databases that tell\ndifferent stories. Another is the basis for comparison, the domains common to both data sets is not\nstated. The use of similar questions in the qualitative data collection (e.g., interviews about stress) need\nto be the same types of questions in the quantitative data collection (e.g., stress scales). Failure to\nacknowledge the implications of the different sample sizes from the quantitative and qualitative databases\nrepresents another potential threat.\nExplanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design\nThe intent of the explanatory sequential design is to explain initial quantitative results with qualitative data\nby connecting the two databases (see Figure 10.2). In this two-phase design, the first phase involves\ncollecting quantitative data, analyzing the results, and then gathering qualitative data to explain the\nquantitative results in more detail. The quantitative results typically inform (a) the types of participants\npurposefully selected for the qualitative phase and (b) the types of questions asked of the participants.\nThe design rests on the assumption that the quantitative results may yield surprising results; unusual,\nsignificant, or outlier results; or demographics that need further explanation. In addition, the qualitative\ndata can explain how the quantitative mechanisms or causal links work. The qualitative follow-up then\nprovides this further explanation in this two-phase project. The key idea is that the qualitative data\ncollection builds directly on the quantitative results. For example, when using demographics, the\nresearcher could find that individuals in different socioeconomic levels respond differently to the\ndependent variables in the initial quantitative phase. Thus, the follow-up qualitatively may group\nrespondents to the quantitative phase into different categories and conduct qualitative data collection with\nindividuals representing each of the categories.\nThis type of design appeals to beginning researchers because of its two-phase approach so that data\ncollection can be paced out over time. It also interests researchers coming to mixed methods from a\nquantitative background because it starts with a strong quantitative first phase. It requires that\nresearchers locate and use a good instrument for first-phase data collection.\nThe data collection procedures proceed in two distinct phases with rigorous quantitative sampling in the\nfirst phase and with purposeful sampling in the second, qualitative phase. One challenge in planning this\ndesign requires the researcher to anticipate the qualitative data collection without completing the initial\nquantitative phase. In developing a plan, we recommend that researchers anticipate the quantitative\nresults based on prior literature and theory. Selecting the qualitative sample represents another challenge\nin this design. Because the qualitative follow-up builds on the quantitative results, the qualitative sample\nneeds to be a subset of the participants in the quantitative sample.\nThe integrative data analysis starts with the separate analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data\nanalysis. Then the researcher connects the two databases by arraying the quantitative results with the\nqualitative data collection. This represents the point of integration. This can be done with a joint display\nas shown in Table 10.3. The template for this design shows columns for first the quantitative scores and\nthen the qualitative follow-up themes that build on the quantitative results. Thus, the joint display, read\nfrom left to right, follows the order of procedures in the explanatory sequential design.\nTable 10.3 Template for an Explanatory Sequential Design Joint Display",

        "text": "different samples for each phase of the study. If explaining the quantitative results in more depth, it\nmakes sense to select the qualitative sample from individuals who participated in the quantitative sample.\nThis maximizes the importance of one phase explaining the other, a strong validation point.\nExploratory Sequential Mixed Methods Design\nThe primary intent of the exploratory sequential design is to explore how qualitative data can improve\n(and make specific to a setting) quantitative measures, scales, or instruments (see Figure 10.2).\nProcedurally, this means connecting the quantitative findings to a design phase for developing a\ncontextually sensitive measurement (e.g., instrument) and then testing it with a sample. Other times it\nmay involve developing new variables not available in the literature attuned to a specific population or\ndesigning a website or an internet application shaped to the needs of the individuals. It can also\ngeneralize findings from a small, qualitative sample to a larger, quantitative sample. Starting with\nqualitative data collection, it presents the reverse sequence from an explanatory sequential design, which\nbegins with collecting quantitative data. We call this design a three-phase design with the qualitative\nphase, followed by a design phase for modifying a quantitative assessment, and then by a quantitative\nphase for testing the newly designed quantitative feature.\nThis design is popular in international and global health research. In undertaking these studies,\nresearchers may need to understand a community or population before administering Western-based\nEnglish instruments. Also, in some studies, adequate quantitative measures or instruments may not be\navailable, and the researcher first needs to gather data qualitatively. A prime example would be using this\ndesign to develop a survey or questionnaire instrument because one is not available in the literature.\nIn this core design, the data collection procedures occur at two points in the design: the initial qualitative\ndata collection and the test of the quantitative feature in the third phase of the project. The challenge is\nhow to use the information from the initial qualitative phase to build or identify the quantitative feature in\nthe second phase.\nSeveral options exist, and we will use the approach of developing a culturally sensitive instrument as an\nillustration. The qualitative data analysis can be used to develop an instrument with good psychometric\nproperties (i.e., validity, reliability). The qualitative data analysis will yield quotes, codes, and themes (see\nChapter 9). The development of an instrument (or questionnaire) can proceed by using the quotes to\nwrite items for an instrument, the codes to develop variables that group the items, and themes that group\nthe codes into scales. This is a useful procedure for moving from qualitative data analysis to scale\ndevelopment (the quantitative feature developed in the second phase). Scale development also needs to\nfollow good procedures for instrument design, such as item discrimination, construct validity, and\nreliability estimates (see DeVellis, 2017).\nDeveloping a good psychometric instrument that fits the sample and population under study is not the only\nuse of this design. A researcher can analyze the qualitative data to develop new variables that may not\nbe present in the literature, to modify the types of scales that might exist in current instruments, or to\nform categories of information explored further in a quantitative phase.\nThe question arises whether the sample for the qualitative phase is the same for the quantitative phase.\nThis cannot be because the qualitative sample is typically much smaller than a quantitative sample\nneeded to generalize from a sample to a population. Sometimes mixed methods researchers will use\nentirely different samples for the qualitative (first phase) and quantitative components (third phase) of the\nstudy. However, a good procedure is to draw both samples from the same population but make sure that\nthe individuals for both samples are not the same. To have individuals help develop an instrument and\nthen to survey them in the quantitative phase would introduce confounding factors into the study.\nIn this design, the researcher in integrative data analysis begins by analyzing the two databases\nseparately and using the findings from the initial exploratory database to build into a feature for\nquantitative analysis. Integration in this design involves using the qualitative findings (or results) to inform\nthe design of a quantitative phase of the research such as developing a measurement instrument or new\nvariables.\nThese procedures mean that the researcher needs to pay careful attention to the qualitative data analysis\nsteps and determine what findings to build on. If, for example, the researcher uses grounded theory (see\nChapter 9), the theoretical model generated may provide a model to be tested in the third quantitative\nphase. A qualitative case study can yield different cases that become the focus of important variables in\nthe second quantitative phase.",

        "text": "The integrated data analysis can be conducted by advancing a joint display and then interpreting the\nfindings from the display. Table 10.4 shows a template for an exploratory sequential design. The first two\ncolumns reflect the order of procedures in this design from the qualitative phase to the design phase. In\nthis template, we use the example of designing a survey instrument that would be contextually suited to a\nparticular sample or population. From the qualitative data collection, we can translate the findings into\nquotes, codes, and themes that inform the survey items, variables, and scales.\nTable 10.4 Template for an Exploratory Sequential Design Joint Display (using a survey design as an example)\nQualitative Design Features Metainferences\nQualitative Quotes Quantitative Survey Items Analyze the scores on the survey\nQualitative Codes Quantitative Survey Variables Identify variables\nQualitative Themes Quantitative Survey Scales Identify scales\nAs shown in the joint display of Table 10.4, we have added a column for metainferences. In this step,\nresearchers look across the qualitative and design features to test the adapted quantitative assessment.\nIn this phase, we learn about how well the adaptation has occurred. For example, is the modified or\nnewly designed survey yielding good results? Will the test show a sensitivity to the sample and population\nunder study? How will the results compare with the existing literature and theories?\nResearchers using this strategy need to check for the validity of the qualitative data and the validity of\nthe quantitative scores. However, special validity concerns arise in using this design that need to be\nanticipated by the proposal or mixed methods report developer. One concern is that the researcher may\nnot use appropriate steps to develop a good psychometric instrument. Creating a good instrument is not\neasy, and adequate steps need to be conducted. Another concern is that a researcher may develop an\ninstrument or measures that do not take advantage of the richness of the qualitative findings. This occurs\nwhen the qualitative data reports open-ended comments on a questionnaire or does not use one of the\nanalytic methods, such as ethnography, grounded theory, or case study procedures. Finally, as previously\nmentioned, the sample in the qualitative phase should not be included in the quantitative phase because\nthis will introduce undue duplication of responses. It is best to have the sample of qualitative participants\nprovide information for scale, instrument, or variable (or website) design. The same individuals should not\ncomplete the follow-up instruments. Therefore this sample strategy differs from the sampling strategy\nneeded for an explanatory sequential design.\nComplex Mixed Methods Designs\nAfter working with these three core designs—convergent, explanatory sequential, and exploratory\nsequential—that are the foundation of good mixed methods research, we have now branched out to\nincorporate more designs that typically fit complex projects. Importantly, all mixed methods studies have\nat least one core design or multiple core designs. However, complex designs mean that the core designs\nare embedded in frameworks or processes larger than simply collecting, analyzing, and integrating",

        "text": "quantitative and qualitative data. What to call these designs has been an issue. Are they “advanced”\ndesigns (see Plano Clark & Ivankova, 2016), “embedded designs,” or “scaffolded designs?” (Molina-\nAzorin & Fetters, 2022). Regardless of the name, we saw through our workshops and readings that\ndesigns moved beyond the core designs, and we have used the term complex designs. What, then, are\nthese complex designs?\nTypes of Complex Designs\nAfter using the core designs for several years, we talked with researchers who told us that the core\ndesigns did not “fit” their studies well. This opened us to consider other types of designs that better fit the\npractice of mixed methods research.\nResearchers were using mixed methods within experimental procedures or in evaluation studies. Thus,\nwe began formulating an additional set of mixed methods designs beyond the core designs. We called\nthese “complex” designs because mixed methods research became a support within a larger process or\nframework. Examples of these are experiments or interventions, case studies, participatory-social justice\nstudies, and evaluation projects. These examples represent a starting point, but they do not exhaust the\npossibilities of using mixed methods in a supportive role (e.g., social network analysis, geographical\ninformation systems, critical theory projects). In other words, mixed methods has now become more than\na “stand-alone” design.\nDevelopment of Complex Designs\nSeveral books informed our development of complex designs. A useful conceptualization emerged in the\nwork of Plano Clark and Ivankova (2016), where they discussed the intersection of mixed methods with\nother approaches to form “advanced applications” (p. 136). They discussed intersecting mixed methods\nresearch with experiments, case studies, evaluations, action research, social network analysis,\nlongitudinal research, Q methodology, phenomenology, grounded theory, social justice, feminism, critical\ntheory, and participatory involvement.\nAnother step toward complex designs appeared in Nastasi and Hitchcock (2016). Their book presented a\nlongitudinal evaluation of the mental health in Sri Lanka. They suggested that distinct “processes” occur in\nresearch in which quantitative and qualitative data might be used in steps in the overall process. They\nalso addressed that complex designs required multiple phases, multiyear projects, substantial funds,\nmultiple research years, and several core designs,\nExamples of Complex Designs\nWe discuss four examples of complex designs and then a general model for embedding the core designs\nin these processes or frameworks.\nThe mixed methods experimental (or intervention) design is complex design in which both qualitative\nand quantitative data contribute to and are embedded within an experimental process. As shown in Figure\n10.3, this design adds qualitative data collection into an experiment or intervention at multiple points in the\nprocess so that the personal experiences of participants can be included in the research. Thus, the\nqualitative data becomes supportive of the experimental pretest and posttest data collection. This design\nrequires the researcher to understand experiments and to be able to design them rigorously (e.g., a\nrandomized controlled trial). As shown in Figure 10.3, researchers add the qualitative data to the\nexperiment in different ways: before the experiment begins, during the experiment, or after the\nexperiment (Sandelowski, 1996). By embedding the qualitative data into the quantitative experiment, the\nresearcher has constructed an exploratory design, where the researcher gathers the qualitative data\nbefore the experiment begins. By including the qualitative data into the experiment while it is running, the\nresearcher has embedded a convergent core design into the experiment. By following up the experiment\nwith qualitative data, the researcher has embedded an explanatory sequential design into the\nexperiment. The points at which the qualitative data collection and findings connect to the experiment\nrepresent the integration in the mixed methods study.",

We enumerated several\nimportant reasons in Figure 10.2. These lists are representative of the examples of mixed methods\nresearch we have found in the literature. The qualitative data collection can occur at a single or at multiple\npoints in time depending on the resources available to the researcher. This type of mixed methods use\nhas become popular in the health sciences.\nThe mixed methods case study design is another type of complex mixed methods design. In this\ndesign, the researcher embeds a core design within the larger process of developing case studies for\nanalysis. The core design may be any of the three possibilities: convergent, explanatory sequential,\nexploratory sequential. As shown in Figure 10.4, the core design is a convergent design, and the process\nis one of inductively developing cases for description and comparison. We have found two basic variants\nof this design. One is a deductive approach, where researchers establish the cases at the outset of the\nstudy and document the differences in cases through the qualitative and quantitative data. A second is\nmore of an inductive approach (as shown in Figure 10.4), where the researcher collects and analyzes\nboth quantitative and qualitative data and forms cases for comparison. The comparison can be a\ndescription of each case followed by discussing the similarities and differences among the cases.\nRegardless of the approach, the challenge is to identify the cases before the study begins or to generate\ncases based on the evidence collected. Another challenge is understanding case study research (Stake,\n1995; Yin, 2014) and effectively embedding a case study design with mixed methods. The type of core\ndesign embedded within this approach can vary, but we can find good illustrations of the design using a\nconvergent design (Shaw et al., 2013).",

A\nparticipatory study is one in which participants (e.g., community members) play an active role in\ncollaborating with the researchers. A social justice study also involves collaboration but adds to it the\nimportance of social change and action to improve the lives of individuals. An example of a participatory\naction mixed methods study is shown in Figure 10.5. As seen in this figure, several steps are involved in\nthe research process, which can involve close collaboration with community members. The research\nprocess goes through a needs assessment to diagnosis the community needs, gathering data from\ncommunity members through reconnaissance, finding a model that would meet the community needs,\nimplementing the model, and evaluating its success. As the process continues, the success of the model\nrequires further evaluation. In any of these steps, the researchers have an opportunity to collect both\nquantitative and qualitative data.

The intent of this design is to engage in a\nprocess of research in which both quantitative and qualitative data and their integration shape one or\nmore of the steps in the process. This approach is typically used in program evaluation where\nresearchers use quantitative and qualitative approaches to support the development, adaptation, and\nevaluation of programs, experiments, or policies. We often find multiple core designs occurring throughout\nthese projects. For example, in evaluating a program, researchers might begin by gathering qualitative\ndata in a needs assessment. From this assessment, a conceptual model is specified and instruments\ndeveloped. The program is then implemented and tested. This, in turn, is followed by a follow-up\nqualitative phase to refine the program. We can see multiple core designs in our example. Moving from\nthe needs assessment to theory conceptualization requires combining qualitative data with a quantitative\nassessment in a core exploratory sequential design. Also, after implementing and testing the program\nquantitatively, we see the follow-up qualitative stage or the embedding of an explanatory sequential\ndesign.\nDescription\nFigure 10.6 A Mixed Methods Evaluation Design Diagram\nIncorporating Core Designs Into Complex Designs\nIn the mixed methods evaluation design example in Figure 10.6, we see that core designs can be\nembedded within a process of evaluation.

The type of design that best suits a problem or question\ncommonly arises with individuals using mixed methods for the first time.\nWe can link a rationale for the choice to the type of design.

For quantitatively oriented fields, the explanatory sequential approach\nseems to work well because the study begins (and perhaps is driven) by the quantitative phase of the\nresearch. In qualitatively oriented fields, the exploratory sequential approach may be appealing because\nit begins with an exploration using qualitative research. In some fields, the choice of approach depends\non collecting data efficiently, and this would argue for a convergent mixed methods study in which\nquantitative and qualitative data are typically collected at roughly the same time rather than at different\ntimes that require more visits to the research site.",

        "text": "Description\nFigure 10.8 Flowchart for Choosing Your Type of Design (Based on Procedures)\nThe Single Researcher Versus a Team\nAnother practical reason for a choice of a design depends on whether a single researcher (e.g., graduate\nstudent) or a team (e.g., funded long-term investigation) conducts the study. If the investigator is a single\nresearcher, the sequential strategies of an explanatory sequential or exploratory sequential approach are\nbest because the investigation divides into two manageable tasks rather than multiple data collection and\nanalysis procedures. The study can be projected out over time rather than collecting multiple forms of\ndata at the same time as in a convergent approach. When time is a problem, we encourage researchers\nto think about a convergent design. In this design, both forms of data are gathered at roughly the same\ntime, and it does not require repeated visits to the field to gather data.\nComplex designs are well suited for a team of researchers who assist in the multiple phases of the\nresearch and for well-funded projects that unfold over several years.\nChoice of Design by Advisers or Mentors\nAdvisers and mentors familiar with mixed methods research may have their choice of an appropriate\ndesign. They may have conducted a mixed methods study or used a specific design in other projects. We\nrecommend that students find a published mixed methods journal article that uses their design and\nintroduce it to advisers and faculty committees so that they have a working model to understand the\ndesign. Because we are at the early stage of adopting mixed methods research in many fields, a\npublished example of research in a field will help create both legitimacy for mixed methods research and\nthe idea that it is a feasible approach to research for graduate committees or other audiences. If a\nresearch team is conducting the study, multiple forms of data collection at the same time or over a long\nperiod of time are possible, such as in an embedded complex design. Although a single researcher can\nconduct a participatory–social justice study, the labor-intensive nature of collecting data in the field\ninvolving participants as collaborators typically suggests more of a team approach than the inquiry by a\nsingle investigator.\nSecondary Reasons for a Choice\nOften beginning researchers will consider the timing and priority or importance of the two databases as\nreasons for a choice of design. We see both as secondary reasons and would redirect energies toward\nrationales based on intent and procedures. Timing and priority are often vague reasons primarily because",

        "text": "the timing of the collection of the two databases can be close in time (i.e., convergent design) or distant\n(e.g., a sequential design). Likewise, priority of the quantitative or qualitative data introduces the ideas of\nauthority and dominance, ideas we believe are seldom useful in thinking about mixed methods. We see\nmixed methods research as giving equal legitimacy to both the quantitative and qualitative data. The\nnotation of the quantitative (Quan) and qualitative data (Qual) has been eliminated in this book edition. It\nis seldom used in mixed methods research today.\nEXAMPLES OF MIXED METHODS PROCEDURES\nExamples 10.1–10.4 illustrate mixed methods studies that use the convergent and sequential mixed\nmethods designs.\nExample 10.1 A Convergent Mixed Methods Design\nClassen et al. (2007) studied older driver safety to develop a health promotion intervention based\non modifiable factors influencing motor vehicle crashes with older drivers (age 65 and older). It is\na good example of a convergent mixed methods study. The abstract identifies the central purpose\nof the study:\nThis study provided an explicit socio-ecological view explaining the interrelation of\npossible causative factors, an integrated summary of these causative factors, and\nempirical guidelines for developing public health interventions to promote older driver\nsafety. Using a mixed methods approach, we were able to compare and integrate main\nfindings from a national crash dataset with perspectives of stakeholders. (p. 677)\nThis purpose statement identified the use of both quantitative (i.e., a national crash data set) and\nqualitative (i.e., stakeholders’ perspectives) data. From one of the research questions in the study, we\nlearned that the authors compared the qualitative stakeholder perspectives, needs, and goals for safe\nand unsafe driving with the quantitative results of the factors that influenced driving injuries. The expected\nintent of the study was to compare the findings. The method section commented on the quantitative data,\nthe statistical analysis of this data, and then the qualitative data and its analysis. Although not stated\nexplicitly, the data were used together to form results, not used for one database to build on another, and\nthe timing was to look at both databases concurrently. A diagram illustrated the procedures involved in\nboth collecting and analyzing the information. A results section first reported the quantitative results and\nthen the qualitative results. More emphasis was given to the quantitative results, concluding that this\nstudy favored the quantitative research. However, the study compared the quantitative and qualitative\nresults equally to identify supportive and non-supportive findings. Hence, the authors used a convergent\ndesign in this study. In the discussion section the researchers merged the two databases in a side-by-\nside comparison. Looking more broadly at the topic we saw that the authors would better accept the\nquantitative emphasis because of their field of occupational therapy. Also, the authors’ biographical\nsketches showed the research was completed by a team of researchers with quantitative and qualitative\nexpertise.\nExample 10.2 An Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design\nIn 2007, Banyard and Williams conducted an explanatory sequential mixed methods study\nexamining how women recover from childhood sexual abuse. It represented a good example of an\nexplanatory sequential design. The quantitative component of the study comprised structured\n(quantitative) interviews (with 136 girls in 1990 and a subset of 61 girls in 1997) looking at\nresilience, correlates of resilience, and these factors over time across 7 years of early adulthood.\nThe qualitative aspect comprised follow-up interviews with a subset of 21 girls about their life\nevents, coping, recovery, and resilience. The intent of the mixed methods study was to use the\nqualitative interviews to “explore and make sense” of the quantitative findings (p. 277). Here is the\npurpose statement:",

        "text": "Multiple methods are used to examine aspects of resilience and recovery in the lives of\nfemale survivors of child sexual abuse (CSA) across 7 years of early adulthood. First\nquantitative changes in measures of resilience over time were examined. To what extent\ndid women stay the same, increase, or decrease in functioning in a variety of spheres\nacross 7 years during early adulthood? Next, the role of re-traumatization as an\nimpediment to ongoing resilience and correlates of growth or increased well-being over\ntime were examined. Finally, because resilient processes in adulthood have not been the\nfocus of much research and require further description, qualitative data from a subset of\nparticipants was used to examine survivors’ own narratives about recovery and healing to\nlearn about key aspects of resilience in women’s own words. (p. 278)\nAs suggested by this statement, the expected intent of the study was to provide a detailed picture of\nresilience and the personal perspectives of the survivors as learned through qualitative data. Also, the\nauthors intended to probe the quantitative findings to explain them in more detail through the qualitative\ndata. With this intent, the study set up as a sequential approach with the two databases connected and\none building on the other. Also, with this approach, the timing illustrated the qualitative data collection\nfollowed by the quantitative results. The project began with a quantitative longitudinal phase with\nextensive discussions of the measures used to gather data. The authors detailed the quantitative results.\nHowever, the qualitative findings illustrated many themes that emerged from the interviews with the\nwomen. These themes pointed toward new issues that helped develop the concept of resilience, such as\nthe turning points in the women’s lives, the ongoing nature of recovery, and the role of spirituality in\nrecovery. The study was conducted by a team of researchers from psychology and criminal justice and\nsupported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nExample 10.3 An Exploratory SequentialMixed Methods Design\nA good example of an exploratory sequential study with an experimental test outcome is found in\nBetancourt et al. (2011). This study used mixed methods research to adapt and evaluate a family-\nstrengthening intervention in Rwanda. The investigators sought to examine the mental health\nproblems facing HIV-affected children in Rwanda. They first began with an exploratory, qualitative\nfirst phase of interviews with children and caregivers. From a qualitative thematic analysis of the\ndata, they then performed an extensive review of the literature to locate standardized measures\nthat matched their qualitative findings. They found some measures and added new ones to\ndevelop a survey instrument. This instrument went through several refinements following rigorous\nprocedures of instrument-scale development (e.g., backward and forward translations, a\ndiscussion of items, reliability and validity) to develop good construct validity for the measures.\nThese measures (e.g., family communication, good parenting, and others) then became the\npretest and posttest assessments in an experimental (intervention) study. For the study’s\nintervention, the researchers used a strengths-based, family-based prevention program related to\nthe measures. The final step in the mixed methods process was to use the validated measures\nwithin a program that featured the prevention program. At various points in this study, the\nresearchers also collaborated with stakeholders to help develop good measures.\nThus, this study illustrated a good, complex mixed methods project with an initial qualitative phase,\nan instrument development phase, and an experimental phase. It showed how an initial exploration\nqualitatively can be used to support a later quantitative testing phase. They stated the purpose of\nthe study as follows:\nIn the multi-step process used in this mental health services research, we aimed to (1)\ncarefully unpack locally-relevant indicators of mental health problems and protective\nresources using qualitative methods; (2) apply qualitative findings to the adaptation of\nmental health measures and the development of a locally-informed intervention; (3)\nvalidate the selected mental health measures; and (4) apply the measures to rigorous\nevaluation research on the effectiveness of the intervention chosen through the mixed\nmethods process.

        "text": "In this mixed methods study, the expected intent was to develop good psychometric measures and then\nto use the measures as outcomes in an experimental project. It was also to use the qualitative data to\ndevelop hypotheses to test using the intervention in the experiment. The initial phase of qualitative data\ncollection was connected to the subsequent quantitative measures and their rigorous testing for scores\non validity and reliability. The entire project was timed for the quantitative phase to follow the qualitative\nphase, and the quantitative phase could be stated as the development of the measures (and survey) and\nthe experimental intervention study. The emphasis in the project favored quantitative research, and the\nproject pointed toward the program intervention test at the end of the article. Recognizing that the\nresearchers came from public health, an organization called Partners in Health, and a children’s hospital,\nthe strong quantitative orientation of the project makes sense. Overall, this mixed methods study\nillustrated the core exploratory sequential design and the more complex embedded experimental design\nwith a sequential focus. With this type of complex project, understandably the study involved a team of\nresearchers in the United States and in Rwanda.\nExample 10.4 A Social Justice Design\nThe final example is a feminist study using a mixed methods social justice explanatory sequential\ndesign by Hodgkin (2008). This study investigated the concept of social capital for men and\nwomen in households in a regional city in Australia. Social capital described norms and networks\nthat enabled people to work collectively to address and resolve common problems (e.g., through\nsocial activities, the community, and civic participation). The basic mixed methods approach was\nan explanatory sequential design with an initial survey and a quantitative phase followed by a\nqualitative interview phase. As stated by the author, “The qualitative study elaborated on and\nenhanced some of the results from the quantitative study” (p. 301). In addition, the author\ndeclared that this was a feminist mixed methods project. This meant that Hodgkin used a feminist\nframework (see Chapter 3) to encase the entire mixed methods project. She also referred to\nMerten’s (2007) transformative research paradigm, which gave voice to women, used a range of\ndata collection methods, and bridged the subjective and objective ways of knowing (see the\nepistemology discussion in Chapter 1). The purpose of the study was:\nThe author will provide examples of quantitative data to demonstrate the existence of\ndifferent social capital profiles for men and women. Stories will also be presented to\nprovide a picture of gender inequality and expectation. The author will conclude by\narguing that despite reluctance on the part of feminists to embrace quantitative methods,\nthe big picture accompanied by the personal story can bring both depth and texture to a\nstudy. (p. 297)\nThus, in this mixed methods study, the expected intent for the study was to help explain the initial survey\nresults in more depth with qualitative interview data. In addition, the transformative perspective sought to\nprovide a picture of gender inequality and expectations. The databases were used sequentially, with the\nqualitative interviews following and expanding on the quantitative surveys. The researcher sent the\nsurveys to both men and women in households (N = 1431); the interviews included only women in the\nsurvey sample (N = 12). The women interviewed were of different ages, mothers, varied in terms of their\nwork activities (inside and outside the home), and in their educational level of attainment. The timing of\nthe data collection was in two phases with the second-phase qualitative interviews building on the results\nfrom the first-phase quantitative surveys. In fact, the survey data indicated that men and women differed\nin terms of their level of social participation in groups, and in community group participation. The\nemphasis in this study seemed to be equal between the quantitative and qualitative components, and\nclearly the sole author of the study sought to provide a good example of mixed methods research using a\nfeminist framework.\nHow was this framework used? The author announced at the beginning of the study that “the aim of this\narticle is to demonstrate the use of mixed methods in feminist research” (p. 296). The author then\ndiscussed the lack of qualitative research in the empirical studies of social capital and noted the White,\nmiddle-class notion of community that dominated the discussions of social capital. Further, the author\ntalked about lifting the voices of those disenfranchised by gender.\nThe study first pointed out gender differences in social, community, and civic participation within a large\nsample of men and women. After this, the study focused on a qualitative follow-up only with women to",

        "text": "understand their role in more depth. The qualitative findings then addressed themes that influenced\nwomen’s participation, such as wanting to be a “good mother,” wanting to avoid isolation, and wanting to\nbe a good citizen. A summary of the qualitative findings indicated specifically how the qualitative data\nhelped enhance the findings of the initial survey results. Unlike many feminist mixed methods studies, the\nconclusion did not indicate a strong call for action to change the inequality. It only mentioned in passing\nhow the mixed methods study provided a powerful voice to gender inequality.\nSummary\nIn designing the procedures for a mixed methods discussion, begin by defining mixed methods\nresearch, and state its core characteristics. Briefly mention its historical evolution to convey to\nreaders and committee members the importance of this approach to research. Justify the reasons\nfor your choice of using mixed methods as a methodology. Define key terms used in this form of\nresearch because, like all methodologies, researchers use terms unique to the methodology that\nmay not be familiar to the general research community.\nRecognize that mixed methods research centers on collecting both quantitative (closed-ended)\nand qualitative (open-ended) data. Next identify your choice of a mixed methods design,\nrecognizing that designs differ in terms of intent for collecting both forms of data (i.e., comparing,\nbuilding, or augmenting) and the procedures (i.e., merging, connecting, or embedding). Define the\nbasic characteristics of the design, and present a figure (or diagram) of the design. Draft a joint\ndisplay template that fits your design, and indicate that you will add data into the table after\ncollecting and analyzing the data. Indicate potential metainferences that might result from\nconducting your study. Mention the types of validity issues that will likely arise in using the design.\nUse the flowcharts in this chapter on intent and procedures to identify your design. Include a\nstatement about integration in your study. Finally, after writing your mixed methods procedures,\nuse the checklist at the beginning of the chapter to assess the inclusion of key components of this\nmethodology.\nKEY TERMS\nClosed-ended data 232\nComplex designs 233\nCore designs 233\nData transformation 238\nIntegration 233\nIntegration statement 251\nJoint display 233\nMetainferences 234\nMixed methods case study design 246\nMixed methods evaluation design 248\nMixed methods experimental (or intervention) design 245\nMixed methods participatory-social justice design 247\nOpen-ended data 232",

J., & Graham, W. F. (1989). Toward a conceptual framework for\nmixed-method evaluation designs. Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 11(3), 255– 274.\nReading an early study of the purposes and types of mixed methods designs can show how far\nthe field of mixed methods has evolved. Jennifer Greene and colleagues undertook a study of 57\nmixed methods evaluation studies reported from 1980 to 1988. From this analysis, they developed\nfive different mixed methods purposes and seven design characteristics. They found the purposes\nof mixed methods studies to be based on seeking convergence (triangulation), examining different\nfacets of a phenomenon (complementarity), using the methods sequentially (development),\ndiscovering paradox and fresh perspectives (initiation), and adding breadth and scope to a project\n(expansion). They also found that the studies varied in terms of the assumptions, strengths, and\nlimitations of the method and whether they addressed different phenomena or the same\nphenomena. The studies were also implemented within the same or different paradigms and were\ngiven equal or different weights in the study. Further, the studies were implemented independently,\nconcurrently, or sequentially. Using the purposes and the design characteristics, the authors\nrecommended several mixed methods designs.\nTashakkori, A., & Teddlie, C. (Eds.). (2010).
