Several texts provide detailed accounts of its development (e.g., Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). Its emergence can be traced back to the period between 1985 and 1990, when scholars from diverse disciplines, such as management, education, sociology, and medicine, independently began publishing books and journal articles on this research approach (Bryman, 1988; Greene et al., 1989). By the late 1990s and early 2000s, dedicated books solidified the new methodology (e.g., Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998). Notably, the Handbook of Mixed Methods in the Social and Behavior Sciences (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003) played a pivotal role in establishing its broad dimensions and solidifying its status as a recognized research approach."

The field emerged as a distinct area of study by 2007, marked by the launch of its first dedicated journal, the *Journal of Mixed Methods Research*. This growing interest culminated in 2011 when the U.S. federal government, recognizing the potential of mixed methods, issued a report on \"Best Practices of Mixed Methods Research in the Health Sciences.\" This report was subsequently updated in 2018 by the National Institutes of Health's Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences.  \n\nFueled by this momentum, an international community of mixed methods scholars coalesced, leading to the establishment of the Mixed Methods International Research Association (MMIRA) in 2014. MMIRA has since expanded its reach globally, establishing chapters, affiliate groups, and regional conferences in various countries.\n\nThe demand for specialized training in mixed methods research also surged.  In 2015, prominent institutions like Johns Hopkins University, Harvard, and the University of Michigan launched the NIH Mixed Methods Research Training Program. Concurrently, the University of Michigan established its own Mixed Methods Research Program, offering workshops to further develop expertise in this area.\n\nThe integration of mixed methods into mainstream academic practices was solidified when the American Psychological Association included standards for mixed methods research in its widely recognized *Publication Manual* in 2020. This marked a significant milestone, signifying the widespread acceptance and adoption of mixed methods within the psychological community. Today, mixed methods are employed across various disciplines, with numerous empirical studies incorporating this approach. Methodological advancements continue to be published in journals dedicated to the field, and a wealth of resources, including books, have become available to support researchers exploring mixed methods approaches."

While other terms like \"integrating,\" \"synthesis,\" or \"multi-method\" are used in the literature, \"mixed methods\" best captures the essence of this approach. It is important to distinguish mixed methods research from multimethod research, which simply involves collecting multiple quantitative or qualitative data sources without necessarily integrating them. Mixed methods research, on the other hand,  explicitly combines both quantitative and qualitative data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem.\n\nThe following defining characteristics are central to understanding and describing mixed methods research:\n\n* **Data Collection:** The researcher collects both qualitative (open-ended) and quantitative (closed-ended) data to study the research problem or question. \n* **Integration:** The researcher connects the two data sets through a process called integration. This involves systematically combining, comparing, or contrasting the findings from the two data sources.\n\n* **Mixed Methods Design:** The researcher uses specific procedures to integrate the two data sets, known as a mixed methods design. These designs vary depending on the research question and the goals of the study. \n* **Analysis:**  Integration is typically analyzed in a table called a joint display, which visually represents the two databases together. This allows for a deeper exploration of the relationships and connections between the quantitative and qualitative findings.\n\n* **Metainferences:** The researcher draws conclusions, insights, or interpretations from the integration analysis, called metainferences. These metainferences provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the research problem than could be achieved with either data source alone.\n* **Worldview & Theories:**  The study is framed within the researcher\u2019s beliefs, values (worldview), and explanations drawn from the literature (theories). As mentioned in Chapter 1, it's crucial to acknowledge these personal perspectives and theoretical underpinnings when conducting mixed methods research."

It emphasizes that mixed methods research aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding by combining both quantitative and qualitative approaches. \n\nOpen-ended data, as described, involves gathering information where participants are free to express their views without being restricted by pre-defined response options. This allows for richer, more nuanced insights. In contrast, closed-ended data relies on structured response choices, such as rating scales, offering quantifiable results.  The text argues that using these distinct terms is more precise than simply categorizing data as \"numbers versus texts.\"\n\nThis distinction is crucial because different types of data provide unique perspectives. For example, in health research, medical test scores might be closed-ended, providing numerical data about a patient's condition. However, understanding the patient's lived experience would require open-ended questions to capture their personal narratives and perspectives."

As used for a mixed methods design, this refers to\nthe procedures in the research process of collecting data, analyzing data, and interpreting it. Two\ncategories of designs will be discussed here, recognizing that many types have emerged over the years\n(Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Creswell & Plano Clark, in press). We advanced core designs including\nconvergent designs, explanatory sequential designs, and exploratory sequential designs. These designs\nare found in all mixed methods studies. Further, these core designs can be embedded within more\nexpansive processes or frameworks. Here the primary intent is not simply the integration of the two\ndatabases but to have mixed methods support the procedures of a process or framework. We call these\ncomplex designs. Complex designs presented in this chapter include experimental processes,\nparticipatory action research frameworks, case study procedures, and evaluation processes. Rather than\na long list of types of designs, we feel that most studies can fit into these core and complex designs.\nIntegration\nIntegration represents a central concept in mixed methods research. This important concept involves\ncombining or \u201cmixing\u201d in a study or a series of studies information from the quantitative and qualitative\ndata. Integration in our discussion will consist of reasons or \u201cintent\u201d of combining the two databases and\nthe \u201cprocedures\u201d of enacting this combination. Further, integration differs depending on the type of mixed\nmethods design. In terms of procedures the researcher either merges or combines the two databases or\nconnects them by one building on the other. For complex designs, the integration involves embedding one\nor more core designs into a larger process or framework, such as an experiment, evaluation, or a\nparticipant action research project.\nJoint Display\nIn the procedures of combining data, the researcher needs some way to examine the effect of bringing\nthe two databases together. A joint display is a table or graph that presents the side-by-side\ncombination of the two databases. Joint displays differ for types of designs because the procedures for\ncombining vary by designs.\nMetainferences\nAs a researcher examines the joint display table or graph, conclusions are drawn about the insight\nemerging from comparing the two databases. In mixed methods, these insights are called\nmetainferences, which suggests that a researcher concludes quantitative and qualitative inferences and\nthen draws additional inferences (metainferences) based on combining the quantitative and qualitative\ndatabases.\nTHE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A MIXED METHODS STUDY\nThe process of conducting a mixed methods study involves connecting the quantitative and qualitative\ndata to a specific type of mixed methods design. In this design, the researcher draws a diagram of the\ndesign, integrates the two databases, presents the integration in a table or joint display for analysis, and\ndraws insight or metainferences from the results of the integration.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION\nIn mixed methods procedures, after defining the methodology with key characteristics and a rationale for\nits use, the researcher needs to indicate the types of qualitative and quantitative data collected. We start\nwith the data discussion because it is concrete and easily grasped by readers. Our approach involves\nthinking about this form of research as gathering both quantitative and qualitative data and then combining\nthem. In this way, a researcher learns more about the problem under study because insights go beyond\nsimply learning about the quantitative and qualitative results; learning comes from the combination or\nintegration of the two databases. In this spirit, we talk about \u201cmining\u201d the data further when using mixed",

Here the primary intent is not simply the integration of the two databases but to have mixed methods support the procedures of a process or framework. We call these complex designs. Complex designs presented in this chapter include experimental processes, participatory action research frameworks, case study procedures, and evaluation processes. Rather than a long list of types of designs, we feel that most studies can fit into these core and complex designs. Integration Integration represents a central concept in mixed methods research. This important concept involves combining or \u201cmixing\u201d in a study or a series of studies information from the quantitative and qualitative data. Integration in our discussion will consist of reasons or \u201cintent\u201d of combining the two databases and the \u201cprocedures\u201d of enacting this combination. Further, integration differs depending on the type of mixed methods design. In terms of procedures the researcher either merges or combines the two databases or connects them by one building on the other. For complex designs, the integration involves embedding one or more core designs into a larger process or framework, such as an experiment, evaluation, or a participant action research project.', 'classification': 'mixed'}",

In mixed methods research, this refers specifically to the processes involved in collecting both quantitative and qualitative data, analyzing them, and drawing meaningful interpretations. While numerous types of mixed methods designs exist (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Creswell & Plano Clark, in press), this discussion focuses on two core categories: core designs and complex designs.\n\nCore designs encompass convergent designs, explanatory sequential designs, and exploratory sequential designs \u2013 foundational approaches found in all mixed methods studies. These designs provide a structured framework for integrating quantitative and qualitative data. However, researchers can embed these core designs within more expansive processes or frameworks, giving rise to complex designs. Complex designs  include experimental processes, participatory action research frameworks, case study procedures, and evaluation processes (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). By utilizing these core and complex designs, researchers can effectively tailor their approach to address specific research questions.\n\nIntegration lies at the heart of mixed methods research, representing the process of combining information from both quantitative and qualitative data sources. This combination can be driven by various \"intentions\" \u2013 such as seeking a more comprehensive understanding or triangulating findings.  The \"procedures\" of integration vary depending on the chosen design. Researchers might merge or combine the datasets directly, or they may connect them sequentially, building upon each other. In complex designs, integration involves embedding one or more core designs within a larger process or framework like an experiment, evaluation, or participatory action research project."

A joint display is a table or graph that presents the side-by-side combination of the two databases. Joint displays differ for types of designs because the procedures for combining vary by designs. Metainferences As a researcher examines the joint display table or graph, conclusions are drawn about the insight emerging from comparing the two databases. In mixed methods, these insights are called metainferences, which suggests that a researcher concludes quantitative and qualitative inferences and then draws additional inferences (metainferences) based on combining the quantitative and qualitative databases. THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A MIXED METHODS STUDY The process of conducting a mixed methods study involves connecting the quantitative and qualitative data to a specific type of mixed methods design. In this design, the researcher draws a diagram of the design, integrates the two databases, presents the integration in a table or joint display for analysis, and draws insight or metainferences from the results of the integration. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION In mixed methods procedures, after defining the methodology with key characteristics and a rationale for its use, the researcher needs to indicate the types of qualitative and quantitative data collected. We start with the data discussion because it is concrete and easily grasped by readers. Our approach involves thinking about this form of research as gathering both quantitative and qualitative data and then combining them. In this way, a researcher learns more about the problem under study because insights go beyond simply learning about the quantitative and qualitative results; learning comes from the combination or integration of the two databases.

This is where joint displays come in; they are tables or graphs that present the side-by-side combination of these two distinct databases. It's important to note that joint display formats can vary depending on the specific mixed methods design employed, as the procedures for combining data differ across designs. Metainferences As a researcher examines the joint display, conclusions emerge from comparing the quantitative and qualitative data presented. In mixed methods research, these insights are called metainferences.  This term signifies that a researcher first draws inferences from both the quantitative and qualitative datasets individually and then generates additional inferences (metainferences) based on the combined analysis of these two databases.  \n\nThe Process of Conducting a Mixed Methods Study \nConducting a mixed methods study involves carefully connecting the collected quantitative and qualitative data to a specific design. This design is often visualized through a diagram that outlines the integration process. The researcher then combines the data from the two sources, presenting this integrated information in a table or joint display for analysis.  By scrutinizing the results of this integration, the researcher can draw valuable insights or metainferences.\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Data Collection \nIn mixed methods procedures, after defining the methodology with its key characteristics and rationale, the researcher needs to specify the types of quantitative and qualitative data collected. This emphasis on data clarity stems from the understanding that mixed methods research involves gathering both quantitative and qualitative information and then combining them to gain a richer understanding of the research problem.  \n\nLearning in mixed methods extends beyond simply analyzing each type of data separately; it comes from exploring the interplay and connections revealed through their integration. This process is often described as \"mining\" the data further, uncovering deeper insights that might not be apparent when examining the datasets individually."
