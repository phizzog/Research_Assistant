By the late\n1990s and early 2000s, specific books articulated the new methodology (e.g., Tashakkori & Teddlie,\n1998). In 2003, the Handbook of Mixed Methods in the Social and Behavior Sciences (Tashakkori &\nTeddlie, 2003) firmly set the large dimensions of the new field of mixed methods research. By 2007, the\nfield had its first dedicated journal in the Journal of Mixed Methods Research. By 2011, the U.S. federal\ngovernment took an active interest in mixed methods.

To effectively justify its use, understanding its historical development is crucial. Over its 35-year history, mixed methods research has matured into a comprehensive methodology with clearly defined components encompassing problems, data collection, data analysis, interpretation, and written products. It's been recognized as the \"third methodological movement\" (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2010), alongside quantitative and qualitative research.  \n\nThis approach bridges these two established methodologies by incorporating elements of both. Several texts provide detailed accounts of its evolution (e.g., Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). Its emergence is generally attributed to the period between 1985 and 1990, when scholars from diverse fields such as management, education, sociology, and medicine began publishing books and journal articles on this new research approach (Bryman, 1988; Greene et al., 1989). By the late 1990s and early 2000s, specific books solidified its status as a distinct methodology (e.g., Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998).  The publication of the Handbook of Mixed Methods in the Social and Behavior Sciences (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003) further established its significance and provided a comprehensive framework for understanding its application."

By 2007, recognizing its growing importance, the field gained its first dedicated journal, the Journal of Mixed Methods Research. This momentum continued as the U.S. federal government took an active interest in mixed methods by 2011. The National Institutes of Health, Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences, published a report on \"Best Practices of Mixed Methods Research in the Health Sciences,\" which was later updated in 2018, further solidifying the field's credibility and relevance. Driven by this growing interest, an international community of mixed methods scholars coalesced, leading to the formation of the Mixed Methods International Research Association (MMIRA) in 2014. MMIRA quickly expanded its reach globally, establishing chapters, affiliate groups, and regional conferences in various countries.  Recognizing the need for specialized training, several programs emerged in 2015, including the NIH Mixed Methods Research Training Program, housed at prestigious institutions like Johns Hopkins University, Harvard, and the University of Michigan. Training workshops also commenced at the Mixed Methods Research Program at the University of Michigan, further bolstering the field's development.  The growing acceptance of mixed methods research reached a significant milestone in 2020 when the American Psychological Association included standards for mixed methods research in its Publication Manual. This inclusion marked the first time that mixed methods found its way into this internationally recognized style manual, signaling mainstream adoption. Today, mixed methods are increasingly employed in empirical studies across various disciplines. Methodological innovations continue to be disseminated through journal articles, and numerous books have been published on the subject (Molina-Azorin & Fetters, 2022), making mixed methods a well-established and widely accessible research approach."

Secondly, the researcher must connect these two datasets through a process called integration,  using specific procedures known as mixed methods designs. These designs guide how the data are analyzed, often presented in tables called joint displays that showcase the combined insights from both datasets.\n\nThe analysis then leads to metainferences\u2014conclusions, insights, or interpretations drawn from the integrated analysis.

      "text": "Research Design\nThe research design is the procedure used in conducting a study. They extend from the broad\nphilosophical assumptions to the data interpretation. As used for a mixed methods design, this refers to\nthe procedures in the research process of collecting data, analyzing data, and interpreting it. Two\ncategories of designs will be discussed here, recognizing that many types have emerged over the years\n(Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Creswell & Plano Clark, in press). We advanced core designs including\nconvergent designs, explanatory sequential designs, and exploratory sequential designs. These designs\nare found in all mixed methods studies. Further, these core designs can be embedded within more\nexpansive processes or frameworks. Here the primary intent is not simply the integration of the two\ndatabases but to have mixed methods support the procedures of a process or framework. We call these\ncomplex designs. Complex designs presented in this chapter include experimental processes,\nparticipatory action research frameworks, case study procedures, and evaluation processes. Rather than\na long list of types of designs, we feel that most studies can fit into these core and complex designs.\nIntegration\nIntegration represents a central concept in mixed methods research. This important concept involves\ncombining or \u201cmixing\u201d in a study or a series of studies information from the quantitative and qualitative\ndata. Integration in our discussion will consist of reasons or \u201cintent\u201d of combining the two databases and\nthe \u201cprocedures\u201d of enacting this combination. Further, integration differs depending on the type of mixed\nmethods design. In terms of procedures the researcher either merges or combines the two databases or\nconnects them by one building on the other. For complex designs, the integration involves embedding one\nor more core designs into a larger process or framework, such as an experiment, evaluation, or a\nparticipant action research project.\nJoint Display\nIn the procedures of combining data, the researcher needs some way to examine the effect of bringing\nthe two databases together. A joint display is a table or graph that presents the side-by-side\ncombination of the two databases. Joint displays differ for types of designs because the procedures for\ncombining vary by designs.\nMetainferences\nAs a researcher examines the joint display table or graph, conclusions are drawn about the insight\nemerging from comparing the two databases. In mixed methods, these insights are called\nmetainferences, which suggests that a researcher concludes quantitative and qualitative inferences and\nthen draws additional inferences (metainferences) based on combining the quantitative and qualitative\ndatabases.\nTHE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A MIXED METHODS STUDY\nThe process of conducting a mixed methods study involves connecting the quantitative and qualitative\ndata to a specific type of mixed methods design. In this design, the researcher draws a diagram of the\ndesign, integrates the two databases, presents the integration in a table or joint display for analysis, and\ndraws insight or metainferences from the results of the integration.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION\nIn mixed methods procedures, after defining the methodology with key characteristics and a rationale for\nits use, the researcher needs to indicate the types of qualitative and quantitative data collected. We start\nwith the data discussion because it is concrete and easily grasped by readers. Our approach involves\nthinking about this form of research as gathering both quantitative and qualitative data and then combining\nthem. In this way, a researcher learns more about the problem under study because insights go beyond\nsimply learning about the quantitative and qualitative results; learning comes from the combination or\nintegration of the two databases.

As used for a mixed methods design, this refers to the procedures in the research process of collecting data, analyzing data, and interpreting it. Two categories of designs will be discussed here, recognizing that many types have emerged over the years (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018; Creswell & Plano Clark, in press). We advanced core designs including convergent designs, explanatory sequential designs, and exploratory sequential designs. These designs are found in all mixed methods studies. Further, these core designs can be embedded within more expansive processes or frameworks. Here the primary intent is not simply the integration of the two databases but to have mixed methods support the procedures of a process or framework. We call these complex designs. Complex designs presented in this chapter include experimental processes, participatory action research frameworks, case study procedures, and evaluation processes. Rather than a long list of types of designs, we feel that most studies can fit into these core and complex designs. Integration Integration represents a central concept in mixed methods research. This important concept involves combining or \u201cmixing\u201d in a study or a series of studies information from the quantitative and qualitative data. Integration in our discussion will consist of reasons or \u201cintent\u201d of combining the two databases and the \u201cprocedures\u201d of enacting this combination. Further, integration differs depending on the type of mixed methods design.

Core designs, such as convergent designs, explanatory sequential designs, and exploratory sequential designs, form the foundation of most mixed methods studies.

The goal of complex designs is not merely to integrate quantitative and qualitative data but to leverage mixed methods to enhance the overall research process and generate a richer understanding of the phenomenon under investigation.\n\nIntegration, a central concept in mixed methods research, involves combining information from both quantitative and qualitative data sources. This combination can be achieved through various procedures, such as merging or connecting the datasets. The specific integration strategy employed often depends on the chosen mixed methods design. For instance, in complex designs, integration occurs by embedding core designs within larger frameworks, ensuring a synergistic relationship between the different methodological approaches."

A joint display is a table or graph that presents the side-by-side combination of the two databases. Joint displays differ for types of designs because the procedures for combining vary by designs. Metainferences As a researcher examines the joint display table or graph, conclusions are drawn about the insight emerging from comparing the two databases. In mixed methods, these insights are called metainferences, which suggests that a researcher concludes quantitative and qualitative inferences and then draws additional inferences (metainferences) based on combining the quantitative and qualitative databases. THE PROCESS OF CONDUCTING A MIXED METHODS STUDY The process of conducting a mixed methods study involves connecting the quantitative and qualitative data to a specific type of mixed methods design. In this design, the researcher draws a diagram of the design, integrates the two databases, presents the integration in a table or joint display for analysis, and draws insight or metainferences from the results of the integration. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION In mixed methods procedures, after defining the methodology with key characteristics and a rationale for its use, the researcher needs to indicate the types of qualitative and quantitative data collected. We start with the data discussion because it is concrete and easily grasped by readers. Our approach involves thinking about this form of research as gathering both quantitative and qualitative data and then combining them. In this way, a researcher learns more about the problem under study because insights go beyond simply learning about the quantitative and qualitative results; learning comes from the combination or integration of the two databases.

However, the specific design and construction of these joint displays vary depending on the chosen mixed methods research design, as different designs necessitate different procedures for combining data. \n\nAs the researcher examines this visual representation, they draw conclusions about the insights emerging from comparing the two datasets. In mixed methods research, these conclusions are termed \"metainferences\". Metainferences represent a higher level of analysis where the researcher not only draws inferences from the quantitative and qualitative data separately but also synthesizes them to generate new understandings and insights that wouldn't be possible by examining each dataset in isolation. \n\nThe process of conducting a mixed methods study involves meticulously connecting these quantitative and qualitative data points to a specific design. This often begins with sketching a diagram outlining the chosen design, followed by integrating the two databases.
