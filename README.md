Organizing and structuring academic research can be complex, and researchers often struggle with handling large amounts of information, developing a clear framework, and extracting key insights from various sources. The AI research assistant software streamlines this process by using a framework suggested in the book: “Research Design: Qualitative and Quantitative, and Mixed Methods Approaches”. The app features a conversational interface that walks a user through a step-by-step process with guided questions tailored to the type of research being conducted.  

As students' progress through each stage, the AI Assistant uses carefully designed questions to guide them in developing research questions, creating outlines, conducting literature reviews, and structuring their arguments effectively.  The system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide contextually relevant guidance based on the research book's framework. This architecture ensures that the assistant's responses are both grounded in established research methodology and dynamically adapted to each user's specific research context.
